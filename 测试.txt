6192355000735963 I can tell you what ho doesn't do: sleep. As far as I can tell.
6192355000735964 I barely know him.
6192355000735965 "False"? He was a very loyal student. Went overboard even.
6192355000735962 That Ë¹Ëþ¿Ë Â³±ö, akhar, your ¸¸Ç×'s false student. You know him. Tell me what he does at night.
6192355000735967 Why do you care?
6192355000735968 Ask him yourself. During the day, he's in the hospital, working.
6192355000735969 Good question...
6192355000735966 Tell me, what does he do during the night? Where does he hide?
6192355000735971 Precisely. Outsiders have no obligation to honor our traditions.
6192355000735972 For what it's worth, I'm an outsider too.
6192355000735970 He has no respect for the dead. No respect for the body. He cuts bodies open without ¸ñÀÙË¿. He knows not the Lines.\nHe's an outsider.
6192355000735974 Unente... don't tell me. I know.
6192355000735975 I think... Actually, disregard that. I don't think anything.
6192355000735976 I'll take care of him. He's my friend, after all. Not yours.
6192355000735973 The khatanghe are worried. Your friend is doing evil. The blame, as always, will be pinned to us. And we are dwindling by the hour as it is. Mere hundreds left now.
6192355000735978 ÎªÊ²Ã´£¿
6192355000735979 You're right. Otherwise he might die from exhaustion.
6192355000735980 I'm curious now. What <i>does</i> he do at night...?
6192355000735977 He won't say. And we don't have time.\nHe needs to be stopped. Fast. Very fast.
