6192354999872951 
6192354999872952 乔尔基·凯恩决定将我的房屋据为己有。要是我还记得他住在哪里的话... 
6192354999872953 父亲的一封急信，召我赶回故乡。我应该赶快回家。
6192354999872954 ...我现在该去哪？
6192354999872955 我该去找那些还认得我的人，会无条件信任，为我担保的人。
6192354999872956 今天我已经完成了我能做的一切。现在只需等待危险过去。
6192354999872957 被奇怪黑雾笼罩的房屋里的任何东西，都可以被随意取走。
6192354999872958 
6192354999872959 某个重要人物昨晚被杀害了。
6192354999872960 我对我房屋应有的权利终于被收回。
6192354999872961 
6192354999872962 甜蜜的家，磨刀霍霍迎我归。这是什么意思？
6192354999872963 父亲的名单上有一个熟悉的名字。
6192354999872964 卡佩拉有一个孩子帮。她可能知道我的父亲想要他们做什么。
6192354999872965 在父亲的信里，他写下他即将面临一场艰难的审判。或者他写的是“我们”？我不记得了... 
6192354999872966 
6192354999872967 
6192354999872968 我在火车站遇到一个滑稽的狗耳小孩。他在那里做什么？
6192354999872969 家被锁住了。当地政府那肯定有钥匙。我不可能假装我对此漠不关心。
6192354999872970 
6192354999872971 狗之杀手就是清晨看见我的狗头小孩。他可以帮我做不在场证明。 \n\n但我答应过诺克金。凶手将被审判。
6192354999872972 狗之杀手就是清晨看见我的狗头小孩。他可以帮我做不在场证明。但我喜欢狗，而且这家伙令人作呕。让他见鬼去吧。\n\n我想知道诺克金对此有何看法。
6192354999872973 狗之杀手就是清晨看见我的狗头小孩。他可以帮我做不在场证明。我们会在城镇大厅碰头。\n\n我想知道诺克金对此有何看法。
6192354999872974 
6192354999872975 有预言说我不久会“招致流血千里”。 可能某些人会死于我的刀下吧。
6192354999872976 我们孩提时期玩耍的仓库里有三个中毒的患者。 他们似乎需要医疗帮助。
6192354999872977 
6192354999872978 穆克毫无帮助。我可以继续观察格蕾丝直到破晓，不过这可不是什么好主意。
6192354999872979 当地流浪儿找到了凶手，并且正在审判他！不会是...?
6192354999872980 
6192354999872981 
6192354999872982 The Soul-and-a-Halves 想惩罚毒死他们狗的犯人。但我不希望他们做出会抱憾余生的事情。
6192354999872983 The Soul-and-a-Halves  想惩罚毒死他们狗的犯人。血债血偿。
6192354999872984 
6192354999872985 以物易物不仅仅可以获得有用物品，也是拉近人与人距离的方式。 每一个人都有可以分享的东西。
6192354999872986 他们对他做了什么？ …我真的想知道吗? 无论如何，我想我现在有盟友了。
6192354999872987 什么鬼。我替Soul-and-a-Halves把仇报了 … 但是他们应该会感激我的。
6192354999872988 似乎当地流浪儿需要帮助。
6192354999872989 Soul-and-a-Halves 想惩罚毒死他们狗的犯人。但我不希望他们做出会抱憾余生的事情。
6192354999872990 亚历山大 萨普诺夫, 小镇的总督，负责案件的调查。我记得他，一个严厉的人。
6192354999872991 我还没有正式和任何成年男子，成年女子或青少年进行以物换物。
6192354999872992 我还没有正式和任何成年男子，成年女子进行以物换物。
6192354999872993 狗耳男孩没有来。没有目击者。如我所料。
6192354999872994 我还没有正式和任何成年女子或青少年进行以物换物。
6192354999872995 我还没有正式和任何成年女子或儿童进行以物换物。
6192354999872996 似乎萨普洛夫不会听任何辩解。他什么都没问就直接把我扔进了监狱。我这样做真的值得吗...？
6192354999872997 我还没有正式和任何成年男子进行以物换物。
6192354999872998 我还没有正式和任何成年女子进行以物换物。
6192354999872999 我下次应该倾听善意的忠告...应该吗？
6192354999873000 我已经和城镇中各式各样的人进行过以物换物。他们现在把我视作他们的一员了。
6192354999873001 
6192354999873002 父亲死了，我来得太晚了。
6192354999873003 我需要黑蓷薾，血蓷薾，和棕蓷薾的茎，以及赛薇。
6192354999873004 我需要黑蓷薾，血蓷薾，和棕蓷薾的茎。
6192354999873005 刹那-艾丹, 当地传说中的泥换生灵，会窃取年轻女人的形态。
6192354999873006 我需要血蓷薾和棕蓷薾的茎，以及赛薇。
6192354999873007 我需要血蓷薾和棕蓷薾的茎，以及赛薇。
6192354999873008 他们不会怀疑我弑父吧？不可能，绝无可能。
6192354999873009 我需要黑蓷薾，和棕蓷薾的茎。
6192354999873010 我需要血蓷薾和棕蓷薾的茎。
6192354999873011 那样致使我父亲急切召我回来的事物，会不会就是杀死他的凶手？有可能... 
6192354999873012 我需要血蓷薾的茎，以及赛薇。
6192354999873013 我需要棕蓷薾的茎，以及赛薇。
6192354999873014 劳拉 拉薇尔住在河边，一个叫做避难所的房子。我们小时候是朋友。希望她至少能让我睡她那里。
6192354999873015 现在我只需要血蓷薾的茎。
6192354999873016 现在我只需要棕蓷薾的茎。
6192354999873017 劳拉的避难所现在也是我的避难所。她见到我并没有我预期的那么高兴。不过我仍然可以待在她那儿。. 
6192354999873018 我已经收集了所有的草药。
6192354999873019 
6192354999873020 劳拉说她的屋子里有贼。
6192354999873021 一个古怪的客人造访了劳拉的房子。我这个人不迷信，但我怀疑她并不完全是人。 
6192354999873022 见鬼。现在可不是和老朋友婆婆妈妈的时候。
6192354999873023 
6192354999873024 劳拉告诉街坊邻居我是无辜的。附近街区的居民不会再攻击我了。
6192354999873025 所以我们终于见面了。谈不上我们俩有多想见到对方。只要劳拉活的很好，这就足够了。
6192354999873026 
6192354999873027 有预言说我不久会“招致流血千里”。 可能某些人会死于我的刀下吧。
6192354999873028 我邀请鲁宾参加我们当年孩子帮的聚会。我怀疑他会不会来。
6192354999873029 
6192354999873030 我甚至不确定那里有一个女孩。我真的看到了什么吗？
6192354999873031 无论那是什么，她不会再找劳拉麻烦了。显然我成了她的新目标。
6192354999873032 看起来坏格里夫对老朋友叙旧并无兴趣 。他自己的损失！我才不会像老母鸡一样把它们都聚成一团呢。
6192354999873033 
6192354999873034 鲁宾是我父亲的学生。对我来说亲如兄弟。我应该去见他，他需要帮助。
6192354999873035 劳拉, 坏格里夫, 鲁宾, 和我相约天黑后在老地方见面，我们第一次燃起篝火的地方。我希望我们可以重新建立起联系。
6192354999873036 我们计划在老地方重聚我们的孩子帮，不过现在不是怀旧的时候。我想我应该向劳拉道歉。
6192354999873037 一个郊外的油头粉面的家伙友情提示我斯塔克把我当成弑父者。什么鬼，我想我最好无视他。 
6192354999873038 或许旧时的友谊可以修复...但我们的生活却永远无法恢复原来的样子了。
6192354999873039 或许旧时的友谊可以修复,但似乎这也无法实现了...无论如何， 我们的生活却永远无法恢复原来的样子了。
6192354999873040 红头 格里高利 芬恩，简称坏格里夫，总是把我掺和进疯狂的事情中。我们从前在仓库里有个藏身处。
6192354999873041 
6192354999873042 某些夜晚，孩子们会聚集在火车站。
6192354999873043 今天，坏格里夫的帮派愿意救我于危难。明天，我怀疑就未必了。匪类的善意可不会持续太久。
6192354999873044 
6192354999873045 有时候天黑之后，大草原居民会聚集在萨巴的房子里...而且不仅仅是他们。
6192354999873046 一个格里夫的哥们被捅了。我答应过查看他受伤的腹部。只要记得带一把手术刀。
6192354999873047 
6192354999873048 身后的门被锁上了。根据传说，我需要检查屋子，并且点亮我能发现的每一根蜡烛。或者等到天亮。
6192354999873049 坏格里夫的走狗在寻找刹那...用火来烧女人。匹斯沃克活该受着罪。
6192354999873050 
6192354999873051 我点亮的最后只能够的弗尔曼，门开了。无论那是什么，现在都已经不存在了。我现在要做的就是把两个孩子拎出去赶快离开。 
6192354999873052 我是个言出必行的人。手术很成功，他安全了。
6192354999873053 这王八蛋是个没心没肺之人，所以他也不需要他的内脏了。 \n\n我是个言出必行的人。我说过我会切除他所不需要的一切，我确实这么做了。
6192354999873054 我不能永远回避自己的恐惧。迟早我必须得照看父亲的房子。
6192354999873055 第一天
6192354999873056 坏格里夫会记得我—当我还有用的时候，随便了。他并没那么有帮助... 
6192354999873057 外科医生可不是能够随便打交道的人，坏格里夫应该被提醒一下这点。不过他似乎帮不上我什么忙...
6192354999873058 父亲死了。 镇民把握当做罪犯，我现在应该去哪？
6192354999873059 冷静。理清头绪。我应该去找那些还记得我的人，会无条件信任我之人，会为我担保之人。
6192354999873060 老瓦声称和父亲有过商业往来，他购买器官。 \n\n不过我不是萨满长老。当地的传统不允许我切开身体。
6192354999873061 小镇的权贵们终于不再关注布拉克。女巫猎捕结束了。我现在可以安全出去了。
6192354999873062 今天我已经完成了每件重要事情。我可以休息到明天了...或者探索小镇。晚上，它的面貌截然不同。
6192354999873063 我打破了一项大草原的禁忌。我切开了一具身体。这个小镇可不会为外科医生提供最好的工作环境。
6192354999873064 
6192354999873065 某个重要人物昨晚被杀害了。
6192354999873066 器官和热鲜血明码标价，就是这样。如果被人发现，我就死透了。不过老瓦...他会付钱。 
6192355000113151 第一幕
6192355000307651 
6192355000307652 甜蜜的家，磨刀霍霍迎我归。这是什么意思？
6192355000307653 父亲的葬礼将在明天黎明举行。在此之前我几乎没有机会向他致敬。
6192355000352352 
6192355000352353 在父亲的信里，他写下他即将面临一场艰难的审判。或者他写的是“我们”？我不记得了... 
6192355000352354 你可以买每天的口粮或者通过以物换物得到...当然你可以去偷。
6192355000352355 
6192355000352356 我在火车站遇到一个滑稽的狗耳小孩。他在那里做什么？
6192355000352358 如果我找不到个地方见周公，我会困死，字面意思。
6192355000352359 
6192355000352360 狗之杀手就是清晨看见我的狗头小孩。他可以帮我做不在场证明。 \n\n但我答应过诺克金。凶手将被审判。
6192355000352361 高洪河的水被污染了。想要解渴，我必须寻找水桶和喷泉池。
6192355000381351一个格里夫的哥们被捅了。某些事告诉我他活该。我没空搭理这事。
6192355000381352 
6192355000381355 小镇的权贵们终于不再关注布拉克。女巫猎捕结束了。 \n\n我现在可以安全出去了。.
6192355000386851 对这种人渣我完全不像动一根手指，不过看着他人受罪很难受。最后，我还帮了匹斯沃克。
6192355000452151 狗之杀手就是清晨看见我的狗头小孩。他可以帮我做不在场证明。我们会在城镇大厅碰头。
6192355000452152 
6192355000452153 如果我被逼上绝路，我可以在某人的房屋里找到我要的一切。只需要抹杀良心撬锁即可。
6192355000718252 我们孩提时期玩耍的仓库里有三个中毒的患者。 他们似乎需要医疗帮助。
6192355000718253 
6192355000718254 我睡觉时时间依然会继续前进。这样我可以跳过一些事件。\n\n另一方面，如果我无事可做，睡觉是推动事物发展的好方法。
6192355000724253 今天我已经完成了每件重要事情。我可以休息到明天了...或者探索小镇。晚上，它的面貌截然不同。
6192355000724254 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355000724255 
6192355000724256 我可以在破碎之心小酌几杯，怀念我的父亲。
6192355000724257 我可以在破碎之心积攒力量。
6192355000724258 我可以在破碎之心小酌几杯，怀念我的父亲。
6192355000724259 
6192355000724260 没人会谴责我在夜晚杀死强盗。也许还能得到报酬。唔..
6192355000724261 没人会谴责我在夜晚杀死强盗。也许还能得到报酬。唔..
6192355000724262 乱成一团。我剥夺了Soul-and-a-Halves报仇的机会 … 但是他们应该会感激我的。
6192355000724263 鼓风草酒可以揭露隐藏的食物。每一小口都会向我揭露秘密的事件或地点。 
6192355000765151 我没有掺和孩子们的事。
6192355000765152 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355000765153 坏格里夫不再等我。
6192355000765154 我没有寻找鲁宾。
6192355000765155 城镇大厅不再搜捕我。
6192355000814151 今天我已经完成了我能做的一切。现在只需等待危险过去。
6192355000814152 今天我已经完成了我能做的一切。现在只需等待危险过去。
6192355000814951 今天我已经完成了每件重要事情。我可以休息到明天了...或者探索小镇。晚上，它的面貌截然不同。
6192355000818151 有些事不再注定会发生。
6192355000818152 有些事不再注定会发生。
6192355000885351 鼓风草酒可以揭露隐藏的食物。每一小口都会向我揭露秘密的事件或地点。 
6192355000885352 
6192355000885353 城镇中有摆渡人。他们在等我。
6192355000997858 
6192355000997859 
6192355000997860 有预言说我不久会“血流成河”。 可能某些人会死于我的刀下吧。
6192355000997861 
6192355000997862 
6192355000997863 有预言说我不久会“血流成河”。 可能某些人会死于我的刀下吧。
6192355001024251 城镇中有摆渡人。他们在等我。
6192355001024252 
6192355001024253 我想他们把我当做杀害父亲的凶手。谣言会马上一传十十传百。
6192355001024254 人们对我侧目而视。
6192355001024255 人们在街道上躲避我。
6192355001024256 当我接近时，人们锁住窗户，藏起孩童。
6192355001024257 一场猎捕正在进行，寻找任何符合我相貌特征的人。
6192355001211052 似乎当地流浪儿需要帮助。
6192355001406351 
6192355001406352 
6192355001406353 
6192355001406354 
6192355001535851 一场猎捕正在进行，寻找任何符合我相貌特征的人。
6192355001535852 
6192355001535853 如果你听到大地隆隆，去寻其根源。站着不动，她就会向耐心之人展现其根。\n\n浇灌根以血液，她便会报以丰饶之草药。
6192355001535854 
6192355001535855 
6192355001535856 如果你听到大地隆隆，去寻其根源。站着不动，她就会向耐心之人展现其根。\n\n浇灌根以血液，她便会报以丰饶之草药。

6192355001697056 城镇大厅不再搜捕我。 
6192354999916353 
6192354999916354 
6192354999916355 父仇子报。但我必须先查看他的尸体。
6192354999916356 我某种程度继承了遗产。我追寻父亲的道路。我试图照看他的病人...失败了。\n\n不过所有人都把我当做萨满大师了。
6192354999916357 
6192354999916358 父亲的葬礼将在清晨举行。我怀疑这要花费一整天。
6192354999916359 父亲的葬礼将在清晨举行。我怀疑这要花费一整天。
6192354999916360 如果我不抓紧的话，父亲便会无法安息。 
6192354999916361 奥吉姆斯基家族的继承人在一个叫破碎之心的酒吧打发白天.
6192354999916362 
6192354999916363 奥吉姆斯基家族的继承人在一个叫破碎之心的酒吧打发白天.
6192354999916364 他们说大地不接受父亲，字面意思。
6192354999916365 
6192354999916366 他们说大地不接受父亲，字面意思…
6192354999916367 父亲的遗体被埋葬了，按照仪式。
6192354999916368 父亲的遗体献祭给了天空，我不太在乎古老的仪式。 
6192354999916369 I我接受了父亲的职责...无论那是什么。但这到底牵涉到了什么？
6192354999916370 I我不知道我父亲拥有什么，所以我不能对其负责。这对我意味着什么？ 
6192354999921251 父亲的遗体献祭给了天空。没有遵守古老仪式的必要。
6192354999921252 我不知道我父亲的遗体最终归宿，我猜他们把他烧了，我不在场。
6192354999921253 萨巴，也称为艾斯佩蒂, 为我保留了父亲的遗产。
6192354999921254 
6192354999921255 一个叫做艾斯佩蒂的大草原女人为我保留了父亲的遗产。
6192354999921256 这个大草原女人给了我奇怪的物品。这些都是啥？
6192354999921257 我拿到了遗产，但没有真正的继承它。必须用行为去证明我对它的权利。\n\n什么样的行为才能证明我是父亲的儿子？
6192354999921258 
6192354999921259 
6192354999921260 如果我想真正继承父亲的遗产，我必须“追随他的脚步”无论这意味着什么。。
6192354999923051 
6192354999923052 
6192354999923053 格蕾丝正在和我父亲对话。这太疯狂了，怎么可能？
6192354999923055 
6192354999923056 
6192354999923057 和死人对话把格蕾丝折腾得半死。穆克知道和死人见面的另一种方法。一个不那么残忍的方法。
6192354999923058 
6192354999923059 
6192354999923060 父亲死了。我不想为了接触他的鬼魂而牺牲一个女孩的性命。
6192354999923061 我和逝去父亲对话了… \n\n并非如此。我遇到了他，但是我们只是各说各话罢了。
6192354999923062 
6192354999923063 父亲死了。我不想为了接触他的鬼魂而牺牲一个女孩的性命。
6192354999923064 根据穆克和敌人对话的方式，我必须收集一捆草药：三根蓷薾（血，黑和棕），以及一根赛薇。
6192354999923065 
6192354999923066 
6192354999923067 我获得草药了。
6192354999923068 
6192354999923069 
6192355000000351 
6192355000000352 
6192355000000353 我现在有我家的钥匙了。
6192355000000354 
6192355000000355 
6192355000000356 我现在手头有进入秘密工厂建筑的钥匙了。毕竟我不能总是睡在别人的地方。
6192355000000357 
6192355000000358 
6192355000000359 奥吉姆斯基的儿子, 小维拉德批准我父亲进入一间工厂建筑下的秘密房间。 我预感这将会成为我的新家。
6192355000000360 这个可怜孤儿妄想拿着一把草药换取死者的呼唤。 \n\n我气都发不出来。不过我现在手头倒是有不少草药了。
6192355000000361 
6192355000000362 
6192355000000363 藏身处的奇怪装置可以用于制作草药酊剂。
6192355000017451 
6192355000017452 
6192355000017453 一个诺克金的孩子陷入了麻烦。如果不处理的话，他活不到今晚。
6192355000017454 
6192355000017455 
6192355000017456 
6192355000017460 
6192355000017461 
6192355000017462 诊断是治疗之父。为了弄清哪样抗生素能够帮助破烂儿，首先我必须弄清他的三个层面具体哪个生病了。
6192355000017463 
6192355000017464 
6192355000017465 我用父亲的仪器制作出了草药免疫增强剂。这个药方也可以用来诊断其他人的身体毛病。
6192355000017466 
6192355000017467 
6192355000017468 我的治疗帮助了破烂儿。
6192355000017469 
6192355000017470 
6192355000017471 我想是时候光顾一下藏身处了。
6192355000017472 我继承了遗产。我追寻父亲的道路，学会倾听草药的声音。我进入了他的密室学习了他的技艺。我会照看他的病人。我用行动证实了我懂得什么是准则。\n\n我是萨满大师。
6192355000020251 
6192355000020252 
6192355000020254 这些也许是患者名单？… 在我父亲的容器里 。看起来像一些化名。\n\n1. 史迪奇\n2. 卡佩拉\n3. 穆克\n4. 诺克金\n5. 可汗\n6. 格蕾丝\n7. 塔雅 泰吉\n8. [不熟悉的大草原印记]
6192355000020255 
6192355000020256 
6192355000020257 卡佩拉创造了一个孩子帮。它或许知道父亲需要他们的缘由。 
6192355000020258 父亲相信名单上的孩子是小镇未来的关键所在。也许我之后应该留神他们。 
6192355000020259 
6192355000020260 父亲相信名单上的孩子是小镇未来的关键所在。也许我之后应该留神他们。 
6192355000025551 我现在无法接触塔雅。
6192355000025552 
6192355000025553 我现在无法接触塔雅。
6192355000025554 蚁巢被封锁了。也许我应该说服它的主人放我进去？
6192355000025555 
6192355000025556 蚁巢被封锁了。也许我应该说服它的主人放我进去？
6192355000025557 我现在无法接触到可汗
6192355000025558 
6192355000025559 可汗在河对岸的新建筑里几乎寸步不离。我接触不到他。 
6192355000110651 第二幕
6192355000153351 我试图帮助破烂儿，但失败了。我想至少我试过了。
6192355000153352 
6192355000153353 时间紧迫。
6192355000153354 根据诺克金, 学者 丹考夫斯基觉得我值得和他谈一谈，想立即见我。不知是何事？
6192355000153355 
6192355000153356 学者丹考夫斯基觉得我值得和他谈一谈，想立即见我。肯定是要事。 
6192355000153357 伊娃发誓丹考夫斯基在城镇大厅。好吧，这很容易验证。 
6192355000153358 有些不对劲。警报是由城镇大厅传来的。我最好赶快去那。
6192355000153359 伊娃发誓丹考夫斯基在城镇大厅。好吧，这很容易验证。 
6192355000234551 现在平静了。在我干正事前我有时间整理我的思绪。
6192355000290451 萨普洛夫总督正在城镇大厅。他负责父亲的案件。
6192355000290452 
6192355000290453 萨普洛夫总督正在城镇大厅。他负责父亲的案件。
6192355000290454 如果我不抓紧的话，父亲便会无法安息。 
6192355000290455 墓园里发生了某些不可思议的事情。
6192355000290456 
6192355000290457 墓园究竟发生了什么？
6192355000290458 可汗住在多面体中。
6192355000290459 
6192355000290460 可汗在多面体里。
6192355000290461 
6192355000290462 
6192355000290463 
6192355000290464 塔雅·泰吉住在称作“屠宰场”的工棚中。 
6192355000290465 
6192355000290466 塔雅·泰吉在蚁穴，一个巨大的工棚里。
6192355000290467 “巫毒”代表着“装有世界的身躯”，它指的是某种由多部分组成的事物。
6192355000290468 
6192355000290469 “巫毒”代表着“装有世界的身躯”，它指的是由许多活生生的部分组成的事物。
6192355000352351 我不知道我父亲的遗体最终归宿，我猜他们把他烧了，我不在场。
6192355000356960 药品可以用草药，水，和来自人的内在制取。药品的种类千千万万，甚至包括那些商店买不到的那种。 
6192355000356961 
6192355000356962 药品可以用草药，水，和来自人的内在制取。药品的种类千千万万，甚至包括那些商店买不到的那种。 
6192355000372151  有的镇民比看上去了解的更多。如果我不清楚做什么，可以和他们交谈。 \n\n我听说年轻的孩子现在对我有兴趣。
6192355000372152 
6192355000372153  有的镇民比看上去了解的更多。如果我不清楚做什么，可以和他们交谈。\n\n我听说年轻的孩子可能有我要的信息。
6192355000372154 街道空荡荡的。警钟已经敲响。声音是城镇大厅传来的。
6192355000377551 据可靠的消息来源，我应该去见卡佩拉, 奥吉姆斯基的女儿。
6192355000377552 
6192355000377553 据可靠的消息来源，我应该去见卡佩拉, 奥吉姆斯基的女儿。
6192355000381353 我继承了遗产。我追寻父亲的道路，我会照看他的病人。我用行动证实了我懂得什么是准则。\n\n坦白的说，我的行为毫无目的行可言。我不过我运气不错。\n\n不过所有人都把我当做萨满大师了。
6192355000381354 我某种程度继承了遗产。我追寻父亲的道路。我试图照看他的病人...失败了。\n\n我是萨满大师。
6192355000481870 除了七个孩子，名单上有第八个名字：“巫毒”。这是个人名还是个物品？不知道我有一天能不能找出答案。
6192355000481871 
6192355000481872 除了七个孩子，名单上有第八个名字：“巫毒”。这是个人名还是个物品？ \n\n不知道我有一天能不能找出答案。
6192355000597851 我给了破烂儿错误的抗生素。他的病状没有改善。而且我今天不能给他服用更多的药品了。
6192355000601551 他被谋杀了。这就是我所需要知道的。被“谋杀”了。
6192355000601552 是的，父亲被谋杀了。 但...我有种感觉在他死之前他就有些不对经。不过现在也不重要了。
6192355000601553 他被谋杀了。这就是我所需要知道的。被“谋杀”了。
6192355000601554 是的，父亲被谋杀了。 但...我有种感觉在他死之前他就有些不对经。不过现在也不重要了。
6192355000601555 
6192355000601556 我选择不去检查父亲的遗体。我只是...做不到。
6192355000671353 
6192355000671354 
6192355000671355 …可汗似乎有时会离开高塔。意味着只有在他选定的合适场合才能见到他。记下了。
6192355000671356 
6192355000671357 
6192355000671358 死神在粗蔓区找到了住所。听起来像是都市传说。 不过小心驶得万年船。
6192355000671359 我没空验证每一个孩子说的故事。我没有去寻找死神之屋。
6192355000671360 
6192355000671361 我不知道死神是否真的光顾了我的小郑，或者只是一个受感染的床。重要的是一旦我发现了它，就会隔离这块地方。 \n\n疾病肆虐这块街区的几率降低了。
6192355000671362 我没空验证每一个孩子说的故事。让其他人去死神之屋吧。
6192355000738051 
6192355000738052 
6192355000738053 父亲的奇怪装置出故障了。必须要一块废金属和一个好的弹簧来修理它。 
6192355000738054 
6192355000738055 
6192355000738056 第二个装置需要大修。它需要一整个工具箱。 \n\n这些天我一个都没见到过。我会晚些时候继续找。
6192355000739757 
6192355000739758 
6192355000739759 通过混合谁和草药，我可以制得免疫增强剂。它可以提升免疫力，毫无疑问。\n\n神奇的是，它也可以揭示疾病的症状。
6192355000739760 
6192355000739761 
6192355000739762 免疫力可以保护健康，在感染区。我必须让其保持在比较高的范围。保护性衣物可以帮得上忙。
6192355000739763 
6192355000739764 
6192355000739765 
6192355000739766 
6192355000739767 
6192355000739768 免疫力在感染区可以保护健康。衣物也可以。
6192355000739769 
6192355000739770 
6192355000739772 
6192355000739773 
6192355000739774 
6192355000739775 
6192355000739776 
6192355000739777 如果我把免疫增强剂给感染区的百姓，他们就有更高的几率避免感染。\n\n<b>我不能为每个人都做到最好的防护工作。</b>不过这样可以提高我的声望。
6192355000995152 
6192355000995153 
6192355000995154 牛老大希望和我谈谈我继承的遗产...我的家。
6192355000995155 
6192355000995156 
6192355000995157 乔尔基·凯恩决定将我的房屋据为己有。要是我知道他的具体住址就好了... 
6192355000995158 乔尔基·凯恩决定将我的房屋据为己有。我并不打算住那，但是我有自己出售它的权利。\n\n要是我知道哪能找到他就好了... 
6192355000995159 
6192355000995160 
6192355000995161 法官改变了主意。凯恩一家真奇怪。 \n\n为了证明我的所有权，我必须把签署有法官命令的纸送到臀腿区。 
6192355000995162 
6192355000995163 
6192355000995164 被奇怪黑雾笼罩的房屋里的任何东西，都可以被随意取走。
6192355000995165 
6192355000995166 
6192355000995167 我对我房屋应有的权利终于被收回。
6192355000997351 
6192355000997352 
6192355000997353 名单上有个熟悉的名字。
6192355000997851 牛老大维拉德对我有兴趣。他可能知道一些有用的事情。 
6192355000997852 
6192355000997853 
6192355000997854 家被锁住了。当地政府那肯定有钥匙。
6192355000997855 
6192355000997856 
6192355000997857 房子被糟蹋了。我不想生活在做一个他曾经溅满鲜血的地方。 \n\n但是空手而归也不是个好主意。
6192355000997864 卡佩拉是镇子上孩子的头儿。她或许知道父亲想要名单上的孩子做什么。 
6192355000997865 名单上有个熟悉的名字。卡佩拉。他们是这么称呼奥吉姆斯基的女儿的。能够让其他孩子团结在她身旁的成熟女孩。 如果有任何人知道关于名单的事，那必定是她。
6192355000997869 
6192355000997870 
6192355000997871 穆克毫无帮助。或许我应该去找格蕾丝？
6192355000997872 父亲死了。我不想为了再见他一次而牺牲一个女孩的性命。
6192355000997873 
6192355000997874 
6192355000997875 五年前，我离开小镇后的不久，一场可怕的疾病爆发了。父亲… 消灭了它。 \n\n连同疾病携带者。
6192355000997878 这些也许是患者名单？… 在我父亲的容器里 。看起来像小孩的化名。\n\n1. 史迪奇\n2. 卡佩拉\n3. 穆克\n4. 诺克金\n5. 可汗\n6. 格蕾丝\n7. 塔雅 泰吉\n8. ["Udurgh" 印记]
6192355001008860 
6192355001008861 
6192355001008862 以物易物不仅仅可以获得有用物品，也是拉近人与人距离的方式。 每一个人都有可以分享的东西。
6192355001008863 
6192355001008864 
6192355001008865 我还没有正式和任何人以物换物—包括成年男子，成年女子或青少年或孩子。
6192355001008866 我还没有正式和任何成年女子，青少年或孩子进行以物换物。

6192355001013155 我还没有正式和任何青少年进行以物换物。
6192355001013156 我还没有正式和任何孩子进行以物换物。
6192355001013157 我已经和城镇中各式各样的人进行过以物换物。他们现在把我重新视作他们的一员了。
6192355001027051 我还没有正式和任何成年男子，成年女子或青少年进行以物换物。
6192355001033954 
6192355001033955 
6192355001033956 我拿到了草药。
6192355001033957 
6192355001033958 
6192355001033959 我需要黑蓷薾，血蓷薾，和棕蓷薾的茎，以及赛薇。
6192355001033961 我需要黑蓷薾，血蓷薾，和棕蓷薾的茎。

6192355001033972 现在我只需要血蓷薾的茎。
6192355001033973 现在我只需要棕蓷薾的茎。
6192355001033974 现在我只需要赛薇。
6192355001033975 我已经收集了所有的草药。
6192355001094270 
6192355001094271 
6192355001094272 家是你的朋友—你的 <i>命运共同体</i>—所在。 我想知道劳拉在做什么、
6192355001094273 
6192355001094274 
6192355001094275 没有我的参与，我们的孩子帮—劳拉, 格里夫和鲁宾—几乎就没讲几句话。\n\n也许我应该再次把它们聚集起来？ 劳拉不会介意，其他两个人呢？ 
6192355001094276 
6192355001094277 
6192355001094278 我邀请了鲁宾参加我们孩子帮的重聚。他不介意。
6192355001094279 我邀请了斯塔克参加我们孩子帮的重聚。我怀疑他会不回来。
6192355001094280 
6192355001094281 
6192355001094282 我邀请了鲁宾参加我们孩子帮的重聚。他不介意。
6192355001094283 我邀请了斯塔克参加我们孩子帮的重聚。我怀疑他会不回来。\n
6192355001094284 
6192355001094285 
6192355001094286  我邀请了格里夫参加我们孩子帮的重聚。他不介意。
6192355001094287  我邀请了格里夫见见老朋友。他来不来我们拭目以待。 
6192355001094288 
6192355001094289 
6192355001094290 劳拉, 坏格里夫, 鲁宾, 和我相约天黑后在老地方见面。我希望我们可以重新建立起联系。
6192355001094291 我们计划在老地方重聚我们的孩子帮，不过现在不是怀旧的时候。\n\n我想我应该向劳拉道歉。
6192355001094292 
6192355001094293 
6192355001094294  或许旧时的友谊可以修复...但我们的生活却永远无法恢复原来的样子了。
6192355001094295  或许旧时的友谊可以修复,但似乎这也无法实现了...无论如何， 我们的生活却永远无法恢复原来的样子了。
6192355001098254 
6192355001098255 
6192355001098256 某些夜晚，孩子们会聚集在火车站。
6192355001098257 
6192355001098258 
6192355001098259 有时候天黑之后，大草原居民会聚集在萨巴的房子里...而且不仅仅是他们。
6192355001098260 有时候天黑之后，大草原居民会聚集在萨巴的房子里...而且不仅仅是他们。即使萨巴不在了，她的地方也不会改变。
6192355001098261 
6192355001098262

6192355001098268 
6192355001098269 有时候天黑之后，大草原居民会聚集在萨巴的房子里...而且不仅仅是他们。
6192355001098270 有时候天黑之后，大草原居民会聚集在萨巴的房子里...而且不仅仅是他们。即使萨巴不在了，她的地方也不会改变。

6192355001098290 某些夜晚，孩子们会聚集在火车站。
6192355001102159 墓园聚满了人。我怀疑他们是来埋葬父亲的。
6192355001102160 看起来坏格里夫对老朋友叙旧并无兴趣 。他自己的损失！我才不会像老母鸡一样把它们都聚成一团呢。
6192355001134051 
6192355001134052 
6192355001134053 
6192355001134054 
6192355001134055 身后的门被锁上了。根据传说，我需要检查屋子，并且点亮我能发现的每一根蜡烛。或者等到天亮。
6192355001134056 我点亮的最后只能够的蜡烛，门开了。无论那是什么，现在都已经不存在了。我现在要做的就是把孩子们拎出去赶快离开。
6192355001134057 
6192355001134058 
6192355001134059 
6192355001135254 
6192355001135255 
6192355001135256 这一有一个不同寻常的奇怪装置。现在处于故障状态。我必须要两块废金属和两个弹簧来修理它。 
6192355001135257 
6192355001135258 
6192355001135259 父亲的奇怪装置出故障了。必须要一块废金属和一个好的弹簧来修理它。 
6192355001135260 
6192355001135261 
6192355001135262 密室的装置可以永凯生产草浸剂和酊剂。
6192355001135263 
6192355001135264 
6192355001135265 密室的装置可以永凯生产草浸剂和酊剂。
6192355001150451 见鬼。现在可不是和老朋友婆婆妈妈的时候。
6192355001172751 
6192355001172752 
6192355001172753 我不能永远回避自己的恐惧。迟早我必须得回家。
6192355001172754 家被锁住了。当地政府那肯定有钥匙。我不可能假装我对此漠不关心。
6192355001172756 萨巴，也称为艾斯佩蒂，了解我的根源所在。
6192355001181651 所以我们终于见面了。谈不上我们俩有多想见到对方。只要劳拉活的很好，这就足够了。
6192355001183752 我们设法撑到了天亮。无论那是什么，现在都已经不见了。 我现在要做的就是把孩子们拎出去赶快离开。
6192355001360451 点燃蜡烛。愚蠢的主意，但是没有更好的选择了。
6192355001360452 找到两根蜡烛。
6192355001360453 身后的门被锁上了。都市传说是真的！ \n\n根据传说，我需要检查屋子，并且点亮我能发现的每一根蜡烛。或者等到天亮。
6192355001360454 找到三根蜡烛。
6192355001360455找到四根蜡烛。
6192355001360456 找到五根蜡烛，只剩一根了。
6192355001523953 有的镇民比看上去了解的更多。如果我不清楚做什么，可以和他们交谈。
6192355001529551 有些事不再注定发生。

6192355001534851 
6192355001534852 
6192355001534853 我不相信斯塔克真的认为我会弑父。他没有<i>那么</i> 蠢。
6192355001534854 我昨天没见着斯塔克，今天试试。
6192355001534855 鲁宾是个白痴。
6192355001535262 我今天又没见着鲁宾。日...
6192355001535863 一场古怪疾病的爆发把小镇搅得天翻地覆。我想知道接下来还会有什么。\n\n明天将会和出乎我的意料。
6192355001536651 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355001545551 时间紧迫。
6192355001583151 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355001637552 我某种程度继承了遗产。我追寻父亲的道路。我将会照看他的病人。我用行为证明了我知道准则所在。\n\n我仍然不相信“过家家粉”有用。未来可不一定有怎么走运。\n\n不过所有人都把我当做萨满大师了。
6192355001697051 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355001697054 我在不干净的街区应该关注我的免疫力。最好穿上有防护性的衣物。

6192354999974353 致命的疾病吞噬着我的小镇。我们没有经验丰富的医生。\n\n我们该怎么办？
6192354999974354 
6192354999974355 
6192354999974356 有时候，一个普通房子里会传来只有奥吉姆斯卡娅和她女儿才知道的旋律。 \n\n如果我找到这个神秘的音乐家，我可以告诉卡佩拉。
6192354999974357 
6192354999974358 
6192354999974359 某个工人一直在演奏维多利亚的旋律，即使他毫无音乐素养。难道真的有神灵存在？或者有其他解释？
6192354999974360 
6192354999974361 
6192354999974362 某个女孩一直在演奏维多利亚的旋律。难道她无意间听到，想捉弄卡佩拉? 或者有其他解释？
6192354999974363 
6192354999974364 
6192354999974365 换生灵克拉拉一直在演奏维多利亚的旋律。维多利亚早就不复存在了。我应该怎么跟佩拉讲?
6192354999974366 
6192354999974367 
6192354999974368 卡佩拉曾经认为灵魂是永恒的，至少她母亲的灵魂是，现在她不再自欺欺人了。
6192354999974369 现在卡佩拉知道仍有希望存在。或许她的母亲维多利亚依然活着...以另一种形式。

6192355000113153 第三幕
6192355000290470 
6192355000290471 
6192355000290472 “巫毒”代表着“装有世界的身躯”，它指的是由许多活生生的部分组成的事物。
6192355000317751 
6192355000317752 
6192355000317753 剧院里设立了临时医院。每一个医生都在那里。
6192355000356951 
6192355000356952 
6192355000356953 
6192355000356954 
6192355000356955 
6192355000356956 有时，整体不仅仅是部分的综合，它拥有部分所不包含的独特属性。
6192355000356957 
6192355000356958 
6192355000356959 我可以从草药，水，和来自人的内在制取药剂。所有药品，甚至我买不到的。
6192355000356963 
6192355000356964 
6192355000356965 解药必须被研制，不管其他人说什么。 <i>必须</i> 做出来。
6192355000356966 
6192355000356967 
6192355000356968 细菌生存在受感染的器官中。意味着我可以通过它们制作血清。.\n\n酊剂和 <b>被感染的器官</b>混合。 我想我能自己动手...从被感染的尸体中。我会尝试不同的器官。
6192355000361451 
6192355000361452 
6192355000361453 我酿造了...某种东西。但我选对了器官吗？\n\n我需要在感染者身上测试这个药剂。有时候，感染者就躺在感染区的地上。 不过我也知道一些可以当测试对象的名字。 
6192355000361454 
6192355000361455 
6192355000361456 感染的大脑可以制成抗生素。它可以削弱疾病，但无法杀死它。\n\n它不是万灵药。
6192355000361457 
6192355000361458 
6192355000361459 感染的心脏可以制成抗生素。它可以削弱疾病，但无法杀死它。\n\n它不是万灵药。
6192355000361460 
6192355000361461 
6192355000361462 感染的肾脏可以制成抗生素。它可以削弱疾病，但无法杀死它。\n\n它不是万灵药。
6192355000361463 
6192355000361464 
6192355000361465 感染的肝脏可以制成抗生素。它可以削弱疾病，但无法杀死它。\n\n它不是万灵药。
6192355000361466 
6192355000361467 
6192355000361468 感染的血液可以制成抗生素。它可以削弱疾病，但无法杀死它。\n\n它不是万灵药。
6192355000361469 感染的大脑也可以制成抗生素，但仍然不是万灵药。
6192355000361470 感染的心脏也可以制成抗生素，但仍然不是万灵药。
6192355000361471 感染的肾脏也可以制成抗生素，但仍然不是万灵药。
6192355000361472 感染的肝脏也可以制成抗生素，但仍然不是万灵药。
6192355000361473 感染的血液也可以制成抗生素，但仍然不是万灵药。
6192355000361474 
6192355000361475 
6192355000361476 错了。尝试感染的器官完全是一条死胡同。我必须跳出框架。
6192355000361477 
6192355000361478 
6192355000361479 我试图遵循医疗学校教给我的准则，但是丹考夫斯基受过更好的教育也毫无进展。我的优势在于他人不熟悉的传说。\n\n答案存在大草原中。
6192355000361480 
6192355000361481 
6192355000361482 公牛不会感染沙疫？这是真的吗？
6192355000367378 
6192355000367379 
6192355000367380 
6192355000377554 
6192355000377555 
6192355000377556 似乎治愈疾病的解药只能从米诺托身上制取，半人半牛的生物。 \n\n我上哪找这种生物？
6192355000377557 
6192355000377558 
6192355000377559 丹考夫斯基的发现支持了我的怀疑：普通公牛对我们毫无帮助。 \n\n我很高兴我们达成共识，虽然并无作用。
6192355000465360 
6192355000465361 
6192355000465362 悲剧找上了Rod的门。或者说它一直住那？\n\n我不是萨普洛夫家的崇拜者，不过如果我打算拜访他们，应该先从卡特琳娜开始。她的房子在别墅背面。
6192355000465551 
6192355000465552 
6192355000465553 角落里蜷缩的内心反映——比其他屋子要多。
6192355000465554 
6192355000465555 
6192355000465556 镇民坚信萨普洛夫家在它们的房子里包庇瘟疫携带者。
6192355000465557 
6192355000465558 
6192355000465559 暴民的正义解决不了任何事。不过他们寻找的带婴儿的女孩是谁？我有种不详的预感。
6192355000465560 
6192355000465561 
6192355000465562 我安抚了群众，不过他们平息的怒火仍让我不安。沙疫患者不一定会死亡，这是真的吗？
6192355000465563 
6192355000465564 
6192355000465565 一个叫穆克的孤儿敲了我的房门。我预感这不会是我最后一次见到她。\n\n我想她不喜欢我，我应该拿她怎么办...
6192355000465566 
6192355000465567 
6192355000465568 
6192355000465569 
6192355000465570 
6192355000465571 穆克的一些朋友不喜欢我。
6192355000465572 
6192355000465573 
6192355000465574 有传言说，爆发不是偶然发生的。某人 <i>刻意为之</i>。这可能吗？
6192355000465575 
6192355000465576 
6192355000465577 
6192355000465578 
6192355000465579 
6192355000465580 卡特琳娜·萨普洛娃生病了。似乎总督可以听见她脑海里的声音。爱情的力量？或是某些更阴暗的力量？
6192355000465581 
6192355000465582 
6192355000465583 折磨卡特琳娜的灵体是真的，有生命的大地也是真的。它们如此真实，就像这个老鼠先知… 和沙疫自身一样。
6192355000465584 
6192355000465585 
6192355000465586 穆克的某个朋友天黑后在乌鸦石等我。我不喜欢这点。 
6192355000465587 穆克的某个朋友想晚上在大草原见我。我现在没空搭理这种孩子的游戏。'
6192355000465588 
6192355000465589 
6192355000465590 
6192355000465591 
6192355000465592 
6192355000465593 所以穆克的朋友是疾病？什么鬼？谁在说话？谁在嘲讽我？如果它是活的，它想要什么？\n\n见鬼，穆克在哪?
6192355000465594 
6192355000465595 所以穆克的朋友是疾病？什么鬼？谁在说话？谁在嘲讽我？如果它是活的，它想要什么？\n\n穆克不会…
6192355000465596 
6192355000465597 
6192355000465598 没人知道穆克埋葬在何处。
6192355000472453 
6192355000472454 
6192355000472455 晚上公牛将在Ragi Barrow 被献祭。 我想是六点。
6192355000481851 
6192355000481852 
6192355000481853 萨普洛夫抓住了杀害我父亲的凶手！
6192355000481854 
6192355000481855 
6192355000481856 这个大草原男子没有杀害父亲。他没有做错任何事情。
6192355000481857 这个大草原男子把父亲的行踪告诉了不该知道的人。但是他不是凶手。
6192355000481858 
6192355000481859 
6192355000481860 萨普洛夫…又抓住了杀害我父亲的凶手？我很怀疑。
6192355000481861 
6192355000481862 
6192355000481863 这家伙不是凶手。巧的是，他的证词暗示了西蒙·凯恩预先知道了父亲的毁灭。
6192355000481864 
6192355000481865 
6192355000481866 谁谋杀了我父亲?我毫无头绪。只有一件事我可以确定：萨普洛夫懂个锤子。\n\n我在调查中不能再靠他了。
6192355000481867 
6192355000481868 
6192355000481869 除了其他事物，父亲给我留下一份名单。 除了七个孩子，名单上有第八个名字：“巫毒”。这是个人名还是个物品？
6192355000481873 
6192355000481874 
6192355000481875 我名单上的病人正在遭受威胁。
6192355000481876 
6192355000481877 
6192355000481878 
6192355000481879 
6192355000481880 
6192355000481881 诺克金被感染了。\n\n…他不应该先进入“危险”状态吗？这不按套路出牌啊！
6192355000481882 
6192355000481883 
6192355000481884 沙疫威胁着孩子们，不过它的目的不仅于此。它想要的是第八者，巫毒。如果我搞不清它是什么就没法保护它！
6192355000481885 
6192355000481886 
6192355000481887 艾斯佩蒂或许知道巫毒是个人还是个什么东西。 她精通大草原的传说。
6192355000481888 艾斯佩蒂不知道“巫毒”具体是什么。不过也许我可以从她嘴里撬出点别的？ 
6192355000481889 
6192355000481890 
6192355000481891 鲁宾… 他和我父亲相处甚久远。也许他听说过“巫毒”？
6192355000481892 
6192355000481893 
6192355000481894 巫毒是一种活生生的生物。
6192355000481895 
6192355000481896 
6192355000481897 鲁宾屁都不知道。不过他给了我点启发：奥吉姆斯基的儿子在研究大草原传说。我也许该问问他？
6192355000481898 
6192355000481899 
6192355000481900 “巫毒”难以捉摸。 很多人知道这个词，但是很少有人理解其完整的含义。 \n\n弗尔曼·傲云可以向我解释...不过他被和蚁巢锁在一起了。
6192355000481901 
6192355000481902 
6192355000481903 巫毒之耳在废弃的大草原村庄里——不管这句话是什么意思。 现在太安静了，我需要等待。
6192355000491651 
6192355000491652 
6192355000491653 斯塔克·鲁宾在夜晚做些见不得人的勾当。他会在哪？\n\n哦，斯塔克… 算了，好歹朋友一场。我预感不妙，最好快点。
6192355000492451 
6192355000492452 
6192355000492453 所以鲁宾也不在家，意想不到。\n\n看来我得去问问知道每个人行踪的神秘人..
6192355000492454 
6192355000492455 
6192355000492456 鲁宾在仓库工作。我就知道这么多。大海捞针啊...也许能找到一些足迹？ 
6192355000492457 
6192355000492458 
6192355000492459 
6192355000493551 
6192355000493552 
6192355000493553 
6192355000493554 是时候去看看鲁宾那见不得人的勾当搞完了没有。
6192355000493555 
6192355000493556 
6192355000493557 
6192355000493558 
6192355000493559 
6192355000493560 金族人只有当鲁宾“烂成渣渣”才会不去管他。我对此无能为力。
6192355000493561 
6192355000493562 
6192355000493563 
6192355000493564 
6192355000493565 
6192355000493566 
6192355000493567 古老的村庄里没有巫毒，不过我发现了奇怪的血液。我很好奇如何我把它和酊剂混合会怎么样？
6192355000493568 
6192355000493569 
6192355000493570 我向长老担保了鲁宾。
6192355000493571 
6192355000493572 
6192355000493573 神秘的血液制成了一瓶液体。现在，我需要找一个被感染的人测试一下。
6192355000493574 
6192355000493575 
6192355000493576 努力没有白费。我做成了血清，万灵药。我的调配妖彻底治愈了瘟疫。
6192355000508751 
6192355000508752 
6192355000508754 
6192355000508755 
6192355000508756 
6192355000508757 
6192355000584064 
6192355000584065 
6192355000584066 这场灾难的本质尚不清楚。父亲曾经击溃过它。 如果我能记住他的教导就好了...\n\n现在我只记得一星半点。但是我会做出万灵药的
6192355000584067 父亲的死亡真不是时候。我几乎没从他那里学到东西。 \n\没人会直接给我张药方。我必须自己摸索。
6192355000584068 错了。尝试感染的器官完全是一条死胡同。我必须跳出框架。
6192355000584069 万灵药需要一种根本不存在的成分。我必须把一种自相矛盾的东西倒入蒸馏器。\n\n但是我绝不屈服。迟早我会找到答案，或者它会找上我。 
6192355000584070 药品制出了。但是量太少了。现在，比起解决方案，它更像是个概念的证明。\n\n不过，我相信不久我就能找到分享研究成果的人。
6192355000584071 知彼知己，百战不殆。 我指的不是生物学研究。  这个瘟疫<i>是</i> 什么？
6192355000584072 我现在对瘟疫有一丁点了解了。 我需要继续研究。即使是细微的传言也有可能蕴含着真相。 
6192355000584073 这场爆发不仅仅是霍乱，天花或流感。它有隐藏的意义，是不能够用显微镜研究出的。 \n\n我必须继续调查
6192355000584074 他们说不是所有的沙疫患者都会死。他们说爆发的背后存在一个独立的的意志，它来自大地。 \n\n它不仅仅是疾病。
6192355000584075 瘟疫有声音。现在我确信无疑。难道它真的有性格，思想，意志？
6192355000633551 
6192355000633552 
6192355000633553 金族人恨透了鲁宾。如果我不设法支开我的同族，斯塔克就算等到高洪河河水流干也迈出不了仓库一步。 
6192355000633554 四个人在仓库区等待斯塔克。如果我想保护我的朋友，我就得为他铲平道路。
6192355000633555 
6192355000633556 
6192355000633557 鲁宾今天安全了。明天我会看看我这么做是否值得。 
6192355000633558 我才不会为了斯塔克和我的同胞（金族语）干架。如果他得罪了金族人，他应该自己解决。
6192355000633559 
6192355000633560 
6192355000633561 他们又找上鲁宾门来了。像狼一样越来越近\n\n同时对付这么多人太难了。我只需要把他们引走，这样鲁宾就可以逃了。
6192355000633562 
6192355000633563 
6192355000633564 
6192355000633565 我想斯塔克已经成功逃之夭夭了。现在我只需要保住自己的小命。 
6192355000633566 我没有帮助斯塔克。
6192355000643151 
6192355000643152 
6192355000643153 不久，一个公牛将最后一次游街供大家触摸。之后它将被屠宰。
6192355000671363 
6192355000671364 
6192355000671365 某个药剂师愿意向流浪儿付钱，让他们在未感染房屋里寻找没被埋葬的尸体。
6192355000671366 
6192355000671367 
6192355000671368 药剂师解释说这是凯恩家的主意...奇怪。他想版主人们理解死亡，但实际上他只是在扩散感染。 \n\nIt might be educational to let Victor know how the common people interpret their philosophies.
6192355000671369 
6192355000671370 
6192355000671371 人们在家中藏感染的尸体。我可以通过不健康的声音找到这种房子——在脑桥广场，靠近狂热者的药店。届时只需在门上划叉即可。 \n\n如果房子不被检查，感染将会扩散。
6192355000671372 维克多要为他自己的人负责。
6192355000671373 
6192355000671374 
6192355000671375我找到了一个房子，里面有可以的人。这是我要找的吗？不过我不认为里面有尸体... 
6192355000671376 
6192355000671377 
6192355000671378 我标记了一个可疑的房屋。应该继续搜索吗...？
6192355000671379 
6192355000671380 
6192355000671381 我找到了堆积尸体的房子。
6192355000671382 
6192355000671383 
6192355000671384 我标记了藏尸体的房子。现在感染的扩散将被遏制。
6192355000671385 我标记了一个错误的房子。这对防止感染扩散毫无用处...I
6192355000671386 我没能发现有未埋葬尸体的房子。感染将继续扩散。
6192355000671387 我标记了另一栋可疑的建筑，以防万一。
6192355000671388 
6192355000671389 
6192355000671390 玛利亚·凯恩娜也标记了房屋。健康的屋子。\n\n我应该让维克多知道吗？或者信任她给我的理由？
6192355000671391 
6192355000671392 
6192355000671393 玛利亚爱干啥干啥去。她是妮娜的女儿。我们的小镇总是由女祭司掌管。 
6192355000671394 维克多会处罚自己的女儿。不会有更多的健康房屋被标记了。
6192355000676651 我发现了一栋房子里有未被埋葬的尸体。
6192355000739751 
6192355000739752 
6192355000739753 复杂的药剂需要通过大蒸馏器酿造，但是它损坏了。需要一个工具箱修理。\n\n该解决这个问题了。
6192355000739754 
6192355000739755 
6192355000739756 我已经修好了大蒸馏器。现在我可以酿造更复杂的药剂了。

6192355000869055 
6192355000869056 今天，我需要减轻病人的痛苦。医院里有一些止痛药，不过其余的我得自己找。
6192355000869057 完成了今天的值班任务。明天会有奖赏等着我，医院也会有新的工作等待完成。
6192355000869059 今天，病人没有被照料。明天不会有奖赏等着我，但是医院会有更多的工作等待完成。
6192355000869060 今天的任务很艰巨：我必须对三个病人施以正确的抗生素。我最好先用酊剂对他们进行诊断\n\n医院里有一些库存药品，不过其余的我得自己找。
6192355000873151 我没有完成今天的任务。一个病人死了。明天不会有奖赏等着我，但是医院会有更多的工作等待完成。
6192355000873152 我没有完成今天的任务。太多人死了。明天不会有奖赏等着我，但是医院会有更多的工作等待完成。
6192355000873154 今天的任务需要我进行解剖。我需要取出至少六个器官放在舞台的冰柜里，鲜血不算。
6192355000873155 完成了今天的值班任务。明天会有奖赏等着我，医院也会有新的工作等待完成。
6192355000873156 我没有完成今天的工作。 明天不会有奖赏等着我，但是医院会有更多的工作等待完成。

6192355000873191 我昨天没有去医院。新的工作将在早晨等待完成。
6192355000879951 全部搞定。明天会有奖赏等着我，医院也会有新的工作等待完成。
6192355000879952 今天，病人没有被照料。明天不会有奖赏等着我，但是医院会有更多的工作等待完成。
6192355000898752 
6192355000898753 
6192355000898754 从今天起，一个公共基金将会奖励提供医疗工作的医生，甚至还有额外奖励的余地。
6192355001131762 地方当局依靠公共基金保证所有医生的薪水。
6192355001131763 我拿走了我的奖赏。新的奖赏明天才会发放。
6192355001131764 基金会有奖赏等着我。
6192355001131765 今天没有奖赏拿。

6192355001159152 
6192355001159153 有预言说我不久会“血流成河”。 某种意义上，确实有不少“血”。

6192355001169701 
6192355001169702 
6192355001169703 我想我应该拜访劳拉.。至少。镇子上还是<i>有人</i>了解医生也是要吃饭的！
6192355001169704 
6192355001169705 
6192355001169706 劳拉想把她的避难所改造成一个...呃， 无家可归之人的 <i>避难所</i>。为了这个目的，她需要一个私人水桶。 \n\n我应该在小镇中部找一找：脾脏区, 胃区, 脊柱区等。
6192355001169707 
6192355001169708 
6192355001169709 小镇的水桶被怀疑腐败了，甚至被感染了。
6192355001169710 
6192355001169711 
6192355001169712 我发现了一个装有可疑的脏水水桶。但是似乎没有酸性...水看上去只是有些泥泞。 \n\n我得仔细想想该拿它怎么办。
6192355001169713 
6192355001169714 
6192355001169715我现在有了污水样本.\n\n如果我把它带给学者, 他会命令摧毁所有潜在危险的水桶。只剩下三分之一的小镇能够用上水——但是安全的水。
6192355001169716 
6192355001169717 
6192355001169718 
6192355001169719 
6192355001169720 
6192355001169721 我已经下令把可以的水桶送到避难所。劳拉的“生者之家”将会有水源。…我总感觉不太妙。
6192355001169729 我把可疑的样本送到丹考夫斯基那。如果许多水桶被摧毁，小镇居民就很难用上水了。
6192355001169730 我已经下令把可以的水桶送到避难所。劳拉的“生者之家”将会有水源。\n\n…我做了什么？
6192355001169746 
6192355001185751 藏身处的小装置可以用来生产草药酊剂。
6192355001185752 
6192355001185753 
6192355001185754 
6192355001185755 
6192355001197851 
6192355001197852 
6192355001197853 我精疲力竭。也许一瓶鼓风草就可以让我重整思绪？
6192355001200651 我应该把牛血给丹考夫斯基看，他是有显微镜的人。
6192355001200652 丹考夫斯基工作时，我可以打个盹或者做些其他时间。我可以几个小时后再来查看他的进展。 
6192355001200653 我想丹考夫斯基一定完成了对牛血的研究。 
6192355001207751 
6192355001207752 
6192355001207753 就是这样，我再也不玩猜谜游戏了。 我也许该打个盹？真希望永远不会醒来。
6192355001234051 
6192355001234052 
6192355001234053 我知道一个很好的产科医生...他会切除所有必须被切除的一切，包括铁轨。
6192355001234054 
6192355001234055 
6192355001234058 午夜后格里夫将在铁轨等我。我们要一起切除不必要的线。 
6192355001234065 我没有和格里夫一起去。我怀疑没有我的情况下，他是不是还去搞爆炸了？
6192355001234066 
6192355001234067 我们什么都没有炸掉。格里夫说他从来没想过这么做。我们所拥有的只有希望。 
6192355001234068 我没有和格里夫见面。我怀疑没有我的情况下，他是不是还去搞爆炸了？
6192355001234151 
6192355001234152 
6192355001234153 鲁宾现在夜晚待在家里。
6192355001234154 我只需要再放五个器官进冰柜里。
6192355001234155 我只需要再放四个器官进冰柜里。
6192355001234156 我只需要再放三个器官进冰柜里。
6192355001234157 我只需要再放二个器官进冰柜里。
6192355001234158 我只需要再放一个器官进冰柜里。
6192355001234159 萨普洛夫已经找到一次杀害父亲的凶手了。我几乎都没有逃过调查。我不在乎他今天又诬陷谁了。
6192355001234173 
6192355001234174 
6192355001234175 鲁宾累了，累坏了。 我帮不上他。他自己会挺过去...也许不能。
6192355001237052 我需要给三名更多的患者施以止痛药。
6192355001237953 
6192355001237954 
6192355001237955 来自大地的血液提神醒脑。不过如果我把它们都喝了，我就没有样本了。
6192355001237956 我把地底的血液都用完了。没法做实验了
6192355001237957 
6192355001237958 
6192355001237959 我非常担心我的孩子们... 没有我他们在藏身处过得还好吗？
6192355001237960 今天，一个公牛将最后一次游街供大家触摸。之后它将被屠宰。
6192355001238151 我需要给两名更多的患者施以止痛药。
6192355001238152 我需要给一名更多的患者施以止痛药。
6192355001246652 我帮助了一个患者。还有两个。
6192355001246653 我帮助了两个患者，还剩一个。
6192355001251154 
6192355001251155 
6192355001251156 仓库区的流浪儿说他们想出了协助我的点子。我们...走着瞧。
6192355001251157 诺克金的 Soul-and-a-Halves每天都会侦查感染的区域。这帮傻瓜！不过地图也许用得上...
6192355001254451 公牛将在Ragi Barrow 被献祭。如果我想赶到那，我必须在黎明前抵达。
6192355001254452 我是个外科医生，不是屠夫。我的工作是帮助人民，不是切割牛肉。
6192355001254455 巫毒之耳在废弃的大草原村庄里——不管这句话是什么意思。时候对其倾身低语了。
6192355001254456 似乎今天乌云笼罩着亚历山大，而不是卡特琳娜.
6192355001254457 
6192355001254458 
6192355001254459 
6192355001254460 
6192355001254461 
6192355001254462 
6192355001254463 
6192355001254464 一个金族人先攻击的我。其他三个离开了。
6192355001254465 又有三个的大草原居民正在仓库区监视斯塔克。\n
6192355001254466 又有两个的大草原居民正在仓库区监视斯塔克。
6192355001254467 又有一个的大草原居民正在仓库区监视斯塔克。
6192355001254468 该死… 我收拾了每一个威胁斯塔克的人。他今天想做什么都行了。 \n\n我希望他能利用这个机会回家好好睡一觉。
6192355001254469 他们又找上鲁宾的门了。\n\n我没有留下看看他们到底想干什么。他们已经做完了。
6192355001257451 穆克不在藏身处。我想她经常在那个废弃火车车厢里活动。或许她在那？
6192355001257452 穆克没事。多谢老天眼。
6192355001257453 
6192355001257454

6192355001257459 
6192355001262553 劳拉想把她的避难所改造成一个...呃， 无家可归之人的 <i>避难所</i>。为了这个目的，她需要一个私人水桶。\n\n没人会让我直接拿走。我想这需要点计谋。
6192355001270851 我没能参加献祭仪式。
6192355001317952 
6192355001317953 
6192355001317954 当局派遣了一名特殊的政治委员，人们称之为"审判官"。
6192355001325451 
6192355001325452 
6192355001325453 父亲留下了一样微不足道的遗产 : 一个装有一把草药的”容器“和一个奇怪的名单。
6192355001400052 新的工作在医院等待这我。如果这地方能够称之医院的话。
6192355001529560 
6192355001529561 哦，劳拉… 我没有对你施以足够高的关注。不过没有我你也能做得很好。
6192355001529562 我没有即使处理水桶问题。我做了正确的选择吗？ 
6192355001529563 哦，水桶...我没有即使处理这个问题。行吧。
6192355001529564 让药剂师见鬼去吧...
6192355001529565 
6192355001529566 我不相信萨普洛夫找到了真正的凶手。
6192355001529567 让萨普洛夫见鬼去吧。现在可不是时候。
6192355001529568 萨普洛夫是总督。我的身份可不足以帮他——也许有其他方法... 
6192355001529569 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355001529570 我把眼睛从怪异上离开。
6192355001529572 我没有遇到穆克的朋友。
6192355001529573 我实在是不想炸掉铁轨...
6192355001529574 诺克金死了...我应该去献上我的敬意吗？
6192355001529575 鲁宾的事是他自己的事，与我无关。
6192355001529576 我没有找到鲁宾的藏身处。
6192355001529577 我既不是斯塔克的爹也不是他的妈。他自己的麻烦自己决绝。
6192355001529578 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355001529580 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355001529582 
6192355001529584 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355001538451 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355001538956 劳拉想把她的避难所改造成一个...呃， 无家可归之人的 <i>避难所</i>。为了这个目的，她需要一个私人水桶。\n\n我需要一个好的借口拿走一个——这只有在小镇中部可行，其中一个守卫可以运输它。 
6192355001545552 有时候，只有维多利亚·奥吉姆斯卡娅和她女儿才知道的旋律会在小镇中回荡。\n\n是时候告诉卡佩拉我的发现了。
6192355001545553 
6192355001608152 诺克金陷入了麻烦？不会吧... 
6192355001608153 小维拉德想见我。
6192355001609551 所以鲁宾也不在家，意想不到。\n\n看来我得去问问知道每个人行踪的神秘人…
6192355001653002 没有必要尝试可能多的配方了 。
6192355001653003 没有必要尝试可能多的配方了 。

6192355000418354 
6192355000418355 
6192355000418356 一个人无法摆脱自己的厄运，但是可以把它交换掉。至于安娜 安吉尔的情况，一个纺锤是交换的代价。

6192355000556861 
6192355000556862 
6192355000556863 所有疑问指向金族人。杀害父亲的凶手？他签下的债？该死的巫毒？ 泰吉，金族人的喉舌，会解释的。\n\n但是他在蚁穴中。我得想办法打进去。
6192355000556864 
6192355000556865 
6192355000556866 
6192355000556867 没有守卫。蚁穴终于被打开了吗？如果是这样的话，幸存者在哪？

6192355000556887 金族人和塔雅都不同意我带走她。想从这个死地拯救她的方法就是把她和金族人一起带走。
6192355000556888 
6192355000556889 
6192355000556890 金族人想和把他们关在蚁穴里的人面对面:维拉德·奥吉姆斯基。维拉德·奥吉姆斯基…
6192355000562851 
6192355000562852 
6192355000562853 小维拉德认为他得为发生的事负责。他理应受到惩罚。
6192355000562854 
6192355000562855 
6192355000562856 是小维拉德被关在蚁穴中。 他认为他得为发生在金族人身上的事负责，自愿去面对他们。\n\n这是我想要的结果吗？
6192355000562857 
6192355000562858 
6192355000562859 大维拉德认为他得为发生的一切负责。看起来他比表面上看上去更爱儿子。\n\n他将代替小维拉德去面对金族人。
6192355000562860 
6192355000562861 
6192355000562862 两个奥吉姆斯基都去面对金族人的审判，没有我的参与。
6192355000562863 两个奥吉姆斯基都没有去面对金族人，不过他们也不在乎。他们从来不在乎。\n\n他们仍想要一个领导。
6192355000562864 
6192355000562865 
6192355000562866 胖维拉德知道了他儿子的计划。没必要和小维拉德交谈了。必须在他造成损害前阻止他…\n\n我怀疑他们两会不会现在去蚁巢了。
6192355000562867 小维拉德落入了金族人手中。他是一个体面的人，必须为他的行为负责。
6192355000562868 大维拉德落入了金族人手中。发生的一切不是他的责任，但是他依然接受了审判。
6192355000562869 金族人现在听我的了。但是被撕裂的他们无法向前迈进，我必须治愈他们的伤口。
6192355000567376 第四幕
6192355000677651 
6192355000677652 
6192355000677653 鲜血从屠宰场涌出—也许，这就是我寻觅的血？
6192355000677654 
6192355000677655 
6192355000677656 这里，人们饮血生存。
6192355000677657 
6192355000677658 
6192355000677659 这里，人们解剖活物去理解。
6192355000677660 
6192355000677661 
6192355000677662 这里，人们像动物一样撕咬对方。
6192355000677663 
6192355000677664 
6192355000677665 这里，生活着野兽而非人类。生与死对他们而言毫无区别。地底的红色大坑呼唤着我。
6192355000677666 
6192355000677667 
6192355000677668 
6192355000677669 他的耳朵，在大草原等待着。他的心脏，在这里，地底。我终于看到了。我理解了。\n\n巫毒就是我的故乡。
6192355000677671 
6192355000677672 
6192355000677673 …父亲故意将瘟疫带到这个小镇上。
6192355000677674 
6192355000682751 
6192355000682752 
6192355000682753 
6192355000682754 
6192355000682755 
6192355000682756 瘟疫，野兽和奇迹息息相关。杀掉其中一个，其他亦会受牵连。 我的目的值得这样的牺牲吗？
6192355000682757 
6192355000682758 
6192355000682759 父亲的遗产是问题而非解答。他从来不希望我仅仅了解他所了解的一切。\n\n现在我做到了，而选择权在我手上。
6192355000700651 
6192355000700652 
6192355000700653 多面体违反了重力的法则。但是它依然和土地相连。万物都是。
6192355000700654 
6192355000700655 
6192355000700656 多面体是最佳的隔离之地。来自大地的沙疫，无法触及到它。
6192355000702453 
6192355000702454 
6192355000702455 沙疫违反了自己的原则。它带走了我所有的孩子，把它们拖向死亡。 
6192355000702456 
6192355000702457 
6192355000702458 为了制造万灵药，我需要一整个地底河流的血液。多面体像箭一样插入大地并堵住了伤口。移除它，血液就会流出。但是受伤的地方终会死去。\n\n对我来说是个艰难的抉择。
6192355000702459 
6192355000702460 
6192355000702461 
6192355000702462 
6192355000702463 
6192355000702464 
6192355000702465 布洛克将军驱散了所有的儿童。小镇没有未来，除了我所要负责了一群孩子。\n\n父亲也预见了这一切吗？
6192355000702466 
6192355000702467 
6192355000702468 无论付出什么代价都要拯救我的孩子。抗生素，过家家粉，最后一瓶万灵药... \n\n任何能救他们性命的东西。一切即将结束。
6192355000739771 免疫力可以在感染区保护健康。衣物也可以。
6192355000754751 
6192355000754752 
6192355000754753 傲云一定知道蚁穴。
6192355000754754 
6192355000754755 
6192355000754756 傲云是公牛的领头人。他坚信必须用武力去救赎金族人。
6192355000754757 
6192355000754758 
6192355000754759

6192355000754762 
6192355000754763 
6192355000754764 金族人出现了分裂。叛乱分子在蚁巢里四处猖獗。为了重整金族，必须壮士断臂。或者我可以治愈它？T
6192355000754765 
6192355000754766 
6192355000754767 叛乱已经被平息。该和金族人对话了。
6192355000754768 
6192355000754769 
6192355000754770 
6192355000754771 
6192355000754772 
6192355000754773 
6192355000754774 
6192355000761051 
6192355000761052 
6192355000761053 
6192355000761054 
6192355000761055 
6192355000761056 
6192355000761057 弗尔曼·傲云杀了我的父亲。
6192355000761058 
6192355000761059 
6192355000761060 
6192355000761062 
6192355000761063 
6192355000761064 我让傲云活下去。我直视他的双眼，原谅了他，但是他永远无法原谅自己。他的生命充满着无尽的空虚和折磨。
6192355000761065 傲云罪有应得。一切是公平的，一切是应该的。 \n\n任何抉择，现在是正确的，将来也是。
6192355000768952 
6192355000768953 
6192355000768954 
6192355000768955 
6192355000768956 
6192355000768957 阿格莱雅的使命完成了。她在这儿必死无疑。但是她想和我一起逃离这个地狱。\n\n我同意了，我们今晚在车站碰头。
6192355000768958 阿格莱雅的使命完成了。她建议我们一块逃走。\n\n荒谬至极。我有孩子，我有这个小镇。我哪儿都不去。
6192355000773151 
6192355000773152 
6192355000773153 …永别了。
6192355000773154 
6192355000773155 
6192355000773156 阿格莱雅·莉莉奇派信使把摧毁多面体的指令送到司令部。他们到了吗？我应该查看一下。
6192355000773157 阿格莱雅命令摧毁多面体。信使会在今天早上把她的指令送到司令部。\n\n我应该去确认一下他们安全到达了吗？或者说没有...？ 
6192355000773158 
6192355000773159 
6192355000773160 
6192355000773161 军队将在22:00撤离。如果他们收到审判官的指令，他们会开炮。否则，他们会直接离开。
6192355000773162 
6192355000773163 
6192355000773164 信使正在寻找布洛克将军。他可能在任何冲突还在进行的区域。
6192355000776051 
6192355000776052 
6192355000776053 一个信使死于交火。\n\n摧毁多面体。届时血流成河，足以为每个人制得万灵药。这是给予小镇未来的唯一方法。.
6192355000776056 
6192355000776057 
6192355000776058 其中一个信使被丹考夫斯基杀了。为了拯救多面体，他有他的理由。他不知道世界是怎么运作的。 \n\n不过...也许多面体应该继续存在？也许它值得？
6192355000776060 
6192355000776061 
6192355000776062 一个信使还在那儿，流着血。.\n\n如果这张纸送到布洛克将军手中。鲜活的大地将会永远死亡——连同它的奇迹。
6192355000776063 
6192355000776064 
6192355000776065 最后的信使离开了小镇。去哪了？\n\n以往的这时，小镇会对我低语。 但是现在一片寂静。头一回，我必须为自己着想。
6192355000776066 军队正在撤离。我拿着审判官命令唯一幸存的复印件。究竟要不要开炮？我必须在22:00前做出决定。
6192355000776067 
6192355000776068 
6192355000776069 如果我把这张纸带到司令部，炮击将会发生。多面体将被摧毁。流血千里——足以为每个人配制万灵药。
6192355000776070 
6192355000776071 
6192355000776072 如果我烧掉这张纸，或者把它藏到22:00，士兵就会在没有开炮情况下离开。生命不会死亡，大地的奇迹将幸存下去。
6192355000776073 
6192355000776074 
6192355000776075 决定作出了。
6192355000776076 巫毒就是这里鲜活的大地。我选择了她。 古老的原牛将从遗失的时间长河中再次归来。
6192355000776077 巫毒就是这里活生生的人民。我选择他们。沙疫将被永远根绝。
6192355000776078 
6192355000776079 
6192355000776080 多面体将被摧毁。
6192355000776081 
6192355000776082 
6192355000776083 多面体不复存在。鲜血从大地涌出。我需要尽可能地收集它们。
6192355000858851 
6192355000858852 
6192355000858853 格里夫良心发现了。他请我帮忙解散他的老部下，关闭仓库。
6192355000858854 坏格里夫请我帮忙解散他的老部下，关闭仓库。握不喜欢这主意.... 
6192355000858855 
6192355000858856 
6192355000858857 我是个懦夫。
6192355000858858 我杀了巴里。格里夫的老勾当结束了。
6192355000858859 
6192355000858860 
6192355000858861 
6192355000873162 今天，我要在成堆的尸体中寻找幸存者，并把他们安置在病床上，以接受正确的治疗。
6192355000873163 完成了今天的值班任务。明天会有奖赏等着我，医院也会有新的工作等待完成。
6192355000873164 今天，病人没有被照料。明天不会有奖赏等着我，但是医院会有新的工作等待完成。 
6192355000873165 我没有完成今天的任务。一个病人死了。明天不会有奖赏等着我，但是医院会有更多的工作等待完成。   
6192355000873166 我今天只需要在医院待一个小时不出门，听起来很简单...
6192355000873169 他们迟到了，但毕竟还是来了！\n\n完成了今天的值班任务。明天会有奖赏等着我，医院也会有新的工作等待完成。
6192355000873170 太傻逼了。我不想浪费时间。明天不会有奖赏等着我，但是医院会有新的工作等待完成。 
6192355000873173 医生总能在医院找到工作。我应该时不时来瞅一眼。
6192355000873185 
6192355000873186 
6192355000873187 我想知道斯塔克在哪。
6192355000873188 医院既没有医生也没有护工...只有换生灵·克拉拉，祈求治愈一个病人。是完全治愈，而非普通治疗。\n\n这需要一份过家家粉，或者万灵药。
6192355000873189 我完成了克拉拉的请求,治愈了一个病人。这是一个善举。看看明天有什么奖励。 
6192355000873190 我没能完成克拉拉的请求。 明天不会有奖赏等着我。医院几乎空荡荡的... 
6192355000873192 昨天我没有去医院。早晨会有新的工作等待着我。
6192355000873193 医院关门了。
6192355000873194 
6192355000873195 
6192355000873196 鲁宾累了，累坏了。我帮不上他。他自己会挺过去...也许不能。
6192355001055351 
6192355001055354 
6192355001055355 
6192355001055356 弗尔曼·傲云想见我。
6192355001098279 有时候天黑之后，大草原居民会聚集在萨巴的房子里...而且不仅仅是他们。
6192355001098280 有时候天黑之后，大草原居民会聚集在萨巴的房子里...而且不仅仅是他们。 即使萨巴不在了，她的地方也不会改变。
6192355001098287 某些夜晚，孩子们会聚集在火车站。
6192355001131777 我拿走了我的奖赏。新的奖赏明天才会发放。
6192355001131778 基金会有奖赏等着我。
6192355001131779 今天没有奖赏拿。
6192355001159851 
6192355001159852 
6192355001159853 预言中我会"血流成河。"将会有更大的牺牲等着我吗？ 
6192355001169653因为爆发的缘故，我们没有地方埋葬死者。尸体被扔在墓园里。格蕾丝不允许烧掉他们。
6192355001169656 死者不会再纠缠格蕾丝了，但她并不高兴。 冒犯她我无所谓，只要她还活着就好。
6192355001169657 格蕾丝是对的。我们不应该烧掉他们。让它保持原状吧。
6192355001169658 格蕾丝是对的。我们不应该烧掉他们。让它保持原状吧。我希望卡佩拉见到的只是梦。
6192355001169659 死者不会再纠缠格蕾丝了。即使再有成堆的尸体，也无法染指格蕾丝了：因为她从墓园搬走了。
6192355001169660 我们不能烧掉死者。 但是把他们堆积在格蕾丝幼小的内心中也不是个办法。她从墓园搬走了。
6192355001169661 格蕾丝是对的。我们不应该烧掉他们—但是把他从墓园带走也是错误的。\n\n让一切保持原状。我希望卡佩拉见到的只是梦。
6192355001169664 地下太拥挤了。死者在相互尖叫，纠缠。只要我尝试我都能听见。
6192355001169667 卡佩拉想告诉我一些事。我搞不清我为什么知道，反正我就是知道。
6192355001169673 这是 <i>什么</i>？ 幻觉？是它吞噬了死者吗? 这究竟是什么把戏？
6192355001169674 地下太拥挤了，确实...再次见到你我很高兴，我亲爱的故乡。\n\n如果我烧掉尸坑，这就会平息。但应该这么做吗...？ 
6192355001169675 我烧掉了尸坑。为其他掘墓人做出了表率。 错误安放的死者将会减少。
6192355001169695 格蕾丝正在“被撕成两半”。如果我不抓紧的话，某些不好的事将会发生。
6192355001234160 鲁宾现在夜晚待在家里了。 
6192355001234161 
6192355001234162 
6192355001234163 
6192355001234164 
6192355001234165 
6192355001234166 
6192355001234167 
6192355001234168 
6192355001234169 
6192355001234170 
6192355001234171 
6192355001234172 
6192355001251163 父亲死了。傲云不想追求权力。金族人现在有两个领导：工头泰吉和萨巴。
6192355001251164 
6192355001251165 
6192355001251166 泰吉的女儿，塔雅也许还活着。她在楼上某个地方。
6192355001251167 
6192355001257460 穆克死了。
6192355001257461 穆克不在藏身处。我想她经常在那个废弃火车车厢里活动。或许她在那？
6192355001257462 穆克。老天，你活着就好... 
6192355001257463 
6192355001257464 
6192355001257465 穆克在哪?
6192355001288951 
6192355001288952 
6192355001288953 我必须立即见她，这是我的准则。
6192355001288956 
6192355001288957 
6192355001288958 阿格莱雅在哪?
6192355001288959 
6192355001288960 
6192355001288961 是你...我终于找到你了。
6192355001304951 
6192355001304952 
6192355001304953 阿格莱雅怎么样了?
6192355001305551 一个信使在士兵和叛军的交火中被捕了。我可以顺着交战的痕迹寻找他。 
6192355001305552 一个信使在士兵和叛军的交火中被捕了。我想我找到了可能会知晓他下落的人。 
6192355001305554 他们在我包扎土匪之前不会告诉我信使的下落，或者直接强迫我...
6192355001305555 该和信使交谈了。
6192355001305556 一个信使还在那，在街上，流着血。我该怎么找到他！该死！
6192355001305557 
6192355001305558 
6192355001305559 最后的信使正在寻找我。他身受重伤需要医生...外科医生。
6192355001305560 受伤的信使需要我。但是，又一次，我太晚了。
6192355001312951 金族人出现了分裂。叛乱分子在蚁巢里四处猖獗。为了重整金族，必须壮士断臂...\n\n不，或许有其他解决方法。
6192355001312954 我可以回到蚁巢向金族人展现我的力量。但是我相信有其他方法，一个平和智慧的解决方法。\n\n也许我能找到使金族人内部和解的方法。 
6192355001312956 
6192355001312957 
6192355001312958 
6192355001312959 我已经见识了金族人的决心。我知道如何触动叛乱分子的心让他们回来。 
6192355001312960 分裂平息了。该和金族人对话了。
6192355001312961 
6192355001312962 
6192355001314851 我找到了一个幸存者。还有几个要找。
6192355001314852 我找到了两个幸存者。
6192355001314853 我找到了三个幸存者。
6192355001352451 这么多尸体...发生了什么？信使在哪？
6192355001356551 等等...其中一个信使不会再这把？我想我看到了一串血迹。
6192355001397661 
6192355001397662 
6192355001397663 格里夫去大教堂了？可真是个新鲜事。
6192355001397664 
6192355001400053 医院有新的工作等待着我。
6192355001400951 鲁宾不在家。
6192355001401551 二十分钟过去了。
6192355001401552 半小时过去了。
6192355001401553 一小时过去了。没人来。所以...我该做什么？
6192355001407559 
6192355001407560 
6192355001407561 格里夫不再是强盗的老大。似乎这傻逼想去出家...真是让我哭笑不得。
6192355001407562 格里夫… 你的自由精神去哪了？刚出狼窝又入虎口。她把你脑子整坏了吧。
6192355001418951 一个造反者跪了。
6192355001418952 两个造反者跪了。
6192355001418953 三个造反者跪了。再解决一个就够了。他们会收到这条信息的。
6192355001423556 
6192355001423557 
6192355001423558 <i>避难所充满着火药味。生锈的铁。 Snowmelt by a brick wall.一整年。</i>
6192355001423559 
6192355001423560 
6192355001423562 她究竟想去刺杀谁？劳拉, 你这小傻瓜...
6192355001423563 
6192355001423564 
6192355001423565 军队分裂了。各自为战, frightened witless, the heroes. 布洛克将军被逮捕了。
6192355001423566 有些事不再注定发生。
6192355001423567 劳拉…我把她忘了。
6192355001423568 
6192355001423569 
6192355001423570 孩子们在搜捕一个杀人凶手。他们说他会来“ They said he'll come to "Friday's yard when pigs fly overhead." 我想我应该等一会。\n\n会不会就是<i>那个</i>凶手…?
6192355001423571 孩子们在搜捕一个杀人凶手，在它们藏宝处放诡异纸条的人。\n\n会不会就是<i>那个</i>凶手…?
6192355001423572 孩子们在搜捕一个杀人凶手，在它们藏宝处放诡异纸条的人。
6192355001423573 
6192355001423574 
6192355001423575 …我在寻找一个杀人犯，他在寻找一个小偷。于是我们相遇了。什么鬼？
6192355001423576 
6192355001423577 
6192355001423578 那是什么鬼？他是谁？他什么也没做。。这帮小屁孩...
6192355001423579 
6192355001423580 …我在寻找一个杀人犯，他在寻找一个小偷。于是我们相遇了。
6192355001423581 <i>手中握着心脏。你能听见水花四溅的声音吗？来找我们，求您了。是我， 卡佩拉.</i>
6192355001423584 
6192355001423585 
6192355001423586 维多利亚·奥吉姆斯卡娅的女儿是我们的新女祭司。为什么孩子们必须和他们父母很像？
6192355001423587 <i>你没有来...我很抱歉。我尽可能不再见你了...尽我所能。是我，卡佩拉. 维多利亚.</i>
6192355001429855 <i>各种颜色的蜡烛。我正在岬角区等你。</i>
6192355001429856 <i>母亲又一次注视着我。我在等你。</i>
6192355001429857 
6192355001452752 <i>The beige thread has snapped.</i>
6192355001452820 时间到了。我的拖延为我做出了决定。
6192355001452822 巫毒就是这里鲜活的大地。古老的原牛将从遗失的时间长河中再次归来。
6192355001454851 
6192355001465051 卡佩拉想和我讲话的感觉消失了。我想我已经在没有她帮助下完成了... 
6192355001471355 我不在乎劳拉。
6192355001484251 这里，连接必须被制造。\n\n我必须找到， tame, and bind three parts of a whole, 深坑旁的献祭之桌上。
6192355001491451 
6192355001491452 
6192355001491453 军队驻进了小镇。炮兵部队。 亚历山大·布洛克，传奇将军，我们不光彩战争中的英雄。\n\n他们把司令部设在城镇大厅.
6192355001492415 
6192355001492416 
6192355001492417 她告诉我每天汇报工作。我会的。奇怪。Such a beautiful Line, even if misplaced.
6192355001492418 该到见阿格莱雅的时候了。
6192355001492419 又到见阿格莱雅的时候了。
6192355001492420 <i>The sound of paper crushed and thrown away.她不是在召见你，但是现在，她需要你。 </i>
6192355001492437 我不如认为我能找出鲁宾是怎么研发解药的，但是奇怪的鲜血“从耳朵”的地面渗出。\n\n沙肯。巫毒之耳在沙肯。
6192355001492438 
6192355001492439 我要的鲜血在屠宰场中。 弗尔曼·傲云将会让我进去。但是这需要时机。我必须等待。01
6192355001492440 蚁巢被疾病所吞噬。泰吉死了。金族人完全变成了弃儿。\n\n…这对我意味着什么？
6192355001492441 
6192355001492442 金族人是一个整体。幸存者已经离开去沙肯了。
6192355001492445 我已经见识了我的人民真正的面孔。现在是时候教导他们见识另一面了。 
6192355001492448 金族人自由了。
6192355001492449 
6192355001492450 
6192355001494159 
6192355001494160 
6192355001494161 阿格莱雅很忙。现在不是见她的时候。 
6192355001496051 
6192355001496052 
6192355001496053 我已经保护了所有我能保护的人，竭尽我所能。

6192355001520352 一位审判官来到了小镇。她想见我。 我对她一无所知，不过隐瞒不是好主意。
6192355001520353 一位审判官来到了小镇。她想见我。我知道该向她展现什么。
6192355001520354 如往常一样，我先动手后思考。我制作了万灵药？但是用什么做出来的？这是什么的血？这是<i>谁</i> 的血？\n\n为了治愈小镇，我必须弄清楚。
6192355001520356 我们有解药了。代价是鲁宾的生命。\n\n…现在他没法告诉我他是用什么做出来的了。我怎么才能生产更多？我需要某个对血液非常精通之人的建议。
6192355001523954 
6192355001523955 
6192355001523956 他们允许我登上多面体..机会不容错过。

6192355001523959 世界的确很美妙。

6192355001609151 我不如认为我能找出鲁宾是怎么研发解药的，但是奇怪的鲜血“从耳朵”的地面渗出。\n\n沙肯。巫毒之耳在沙肯。
6192355001625952 我试图帮助鲁宾, 但是不够。\n\n谁杀死了鲁宾?不会溅血的金族人？他的良心，永远无法寻找宁静？我的朋友，没能完成他的任务，也是我的任务？\n\n无所谓了。最后，斯塔克死了。

6192355001288969 有些不对劲。我又一次身处剧院。为什么？这对我意味着什么？

6192355000336080 The 4th Division was relocated here by accident. They never wanted to kill their compatriots among the plague. They were planning to do in in the trenches.

6192355000336071 This mask resembles those worn by medical personnel, but instead of sterile gauze, it's made of dirty cloth, and instead of clinging tightly to my face, it hangs loose. Frankly, it's just a rag with two ties.
6192355001377810 
6192355001377813 Repellent Cloak
6192355001377814 It's just a piece of canvas, so it can either be worn or used for sewing.

6192354999869466 你这话是什么意思, emshen?
6192354999869470 那谁能够呢？
6192354999869471 我怎么能够自己承担这个义务？如果我做不到怎么办?
6192354999869469 不。
6192354999869473 这个选择意味着什么？
6192354999869474 我害怕承担他的重任。我把他献祭给天空。
6192354999869475 大地，当然。我父亲的责任就是我的责任...无论是什么。
6192354999869472 你来做出选择。所以你的选择是什么？是把他解放到天空，还是大地？
6192354999869477 很难抉择。我尊重父亲。
6192354999869478 我怎么能够自己承担这个义务？如果我做不到怎么办?
6192354999869476 焚烧他的遗体，把他解放给天空，一个古老低调的仪式。但在过去是，一种为不纯洁、不友善、不忠诚之人准备的仪式。现在，他们经常烧死穷人。不是不光彩的仪式。\n把他交给大地更好。智者说：“大地将我们的死亡作为恩惠归还给我们。”你选择了什么？
6192354999869480 我会的。
6192354999869481 在这等我。
6192354999869479 那就走吧，告知他们。
6192354999869483 很好。我拿定主意了。
6192354999869484 我很软弱，我不想担此重任。
6192354999869482 智者说：“谁可以分清时间的迷雾？“如果”就是软弱。
6192355000640453 我们应该拿它怎么办？
6192355000640452 如果你继承他的遗产，你会了解更多的。我保管着它，我会给你所有现在属于你的东西 。\n但是我们不能遗弃你父亲的身躯。通过我们人民的仪式，他应该已经在昨天被安葬了。
6192354999869486 我很害怕。
6192354999869487 谢谢你， khetey.
6192354999869485 你是一个勇敢的人 emshen.你父亲真正的儿子.当我看着你时，我很高兴。 Khatanghe-the Kin-shed在他们看着你时为你骄傲，流出喜悦的泪水。 
6192354999869490 我不想追寻他的踪迹。我会找到自己的道路。
6192354999869488 何为命运， emshen? 智者说：“命运如同贤妻，” 没有人可以赐予你，但只要你的爱是真诚的，拥有即是幸福。“\ n但你是一个自由的人。你做出自己的选择。你的父亲欣赏自由。
6192354999869492 是的。
6192354999869493 我几乎...什么都不记得了。
6192354999869491 "Khetey" 代表着 "sister-elder." 你是想用这个词来称呼我吗？ Bayarlaa, 谢谢你。你还记得你的人民的一些文化吗？ 
6192354999869495 不。我想独自承担重任。
6192354999869496 我总是先行动后思考。 ekhene. 为了证明这点我已经付出了些伤疤了。
6192354999869494 我们要共同挑起你父亲的重担， emshen. 你的父亲帮助过我；我也帮助过他。我也会帮助你。我从你身上看到了他。
6192354999869498 很好，我很欣慰。
6192354999869499 我做了正确的事，这是我的内心告诉我的。
6192354999869497 你的父亲是个有智慧的人。但他没有把时间浪费在怀疑上。他付之行动而不是沉思。这就是为什么他做出了很多伟绩...... \ n他小心翼翼地生活，在自己的脑袋里踱步，宽恕了自己，但却浪费了他所爱的人......以及那些爱他的人。 But he wasted not his time on doubting. He acted instead of brooding. That's why his works were great, and many…\nHe who lives cautiously, pacing circles in his own head, spares himself, but wastes those he loves… and those who love him.
6192354999869501 好的。
6192354999869500 跟着我， emshen. 你现在正要继承属于你的遗产。
6192354999869503 你是在说你自己吗？你是打算给我算命？ 
6192354999869502 对你而言，她可能很善良。温暖你的床，抚摸你的壁炉，抚养你的孩子。但是一个陌生人，她可能令人讨厌和折磨。无论谁声称她，都会付出惨重的代价。注意这个警告。To you, she might have been kind. Warming your bed, stoking your hearth, bearing your children. But a stranger, she might hate and torment. Whoever claims her, will pay terribly. Heed this warning.
6192354999869506 我猜，我也得盯着你。
6192354999869507 但是我们几乎不了解对方，萨巴。
6192354999869505 也许，也许。
6192354999869509 我们走吧。
6192354999869510 I have devils enough on my shoulder. But… fine.
6192354999869511 不，萨巴。我不想和金族人打交道。我也不需要你。 
6192354999869508 现在我把你留给格里夫。如果需要的话，到我家来找我。我会等着你，无论黑夜还是白天。只要我还存在 tangher, I will stand behind your shoulder.
6192355000640455 是吗？为什么？
6192355000640456 我不在乎。
6192355000640454 的确。如果你抛弃妻子，她会拥抱他人。那样就危险了。
6192354999869513 不好意思，你说什么？
6192354999869514 也许我根本不想继承它。
6192354999869515 我们“没有时间了”是什么意思？我现在有的是时间。
6192354999869512 对伊西多的事我很遗憾。但是我们没有时间悲伤。重要的是：你现在要继承你父亲的遗产。 用心去<i>继承</i> 。而不是仅仅<i>拿着。</i>
6192354999869517 哪种khayud?
6192354999869518 你到底是谁？
6192354999869516 你有十天时间。相信我——我可以预见，十天。Be khara,巨大的灾难—a khayud—会降临于我们。 死亡已经在四个房子里筑巢。不久，它会蔓延到整个小镇，吞噬它，毁灭它。\ n智者说：“天幕陨落，若将之击倒，届时何处可藏？“
6192354999869520 你是对的，他必须有。这就是他召我回小镇的原因...
6192354999869521 为什么是你？
6192354999869522  “温暖的容器”是什么意思？
6192354999869519 在这里 - 我给你他的udhar，他的“温暖的容器”。他在他最后一个假期的前夕把它给了我。预示会降临在他身上的邪恶。Here—I'mis udhm vn this last holiday. Must have presaged the evil that would befall him.
6192354999869524 Like what?
6192354999869525 这是另一种预感吗？或者说你确定吗？
6192354999869523 我不知道。或许是战争，叛乱，瘟疫还是简单的不幸，谁在乎呢？你现在有更多的事情需要担心。I know not. But be it war, rebellion, plague, or simple misfortune, who cares? You have greater things to worry about now.
6192354999869527 我不喜欢物质财富。
6192354999869528 啊......是的，我似乎想起来了。
6192354999869526 你是一个奇怪的人，emshen。你在这里成长，很久以前就长大成人了。既不是鱼，也不是鸡......好吧，让我们希望你的血液唤醒你。\ n udhar是一个容器，用来装对他来说很一切重要的东西。那些......你怎么说“gyur”这个词？保留他本质的东西。总有一天，你会做出自己的一个。You are an odd one, emshen. You were brought up here, yet came of age far away. Neither fish, nor fowl… Well, let us hope that your blood calls to you.\nAn udhar is a vessel where a man keeps all that is important to him. The things that… how do you say "gyur"? Things that preserve his essence. You will, someday, make one of your own.
6192354999869530 很好。所以...？
6192354999869531 我猜我也会相信你的。。
6192354999869529 我是萨巴 Usp'tae.我感受大地的意志。 你的父亲制造了我，给了我名字，相信着我。 
6192354999869533 好的。你说我“接受”我的遗产，但没有“继承它”。那是什么意思？
6192354999869534 听着，khetey, 我不想要它。 我拒绝了他的义务，所以接受他的财物是不合适的。
6192354999869532 我给你他的udkhar。现在是你的了，里面的东西也是。此外，财产...钱包很轻，不是吗？你父亲并不在乎钱。
6192354999869536 Why would I?
6192354999869535 这是我听到你的骄傲吗？还是你的血，emshen。无论他欠什么，都与他所拥有的不一样。没有必要发脾气，你不知道接下来会发生什么......也许你会改变主意。Is this pride I hear from you? Still your blood, emshen. Whatever he owed, it is not the same as what he owned. There's no need for a tantrum, and you know not what comes next… Perhaps you will change your mind.
6192354999869538 Yes, I gathered as much. 但是我需要做什么？
6192354999869539 所以，还有什么？
6192354999869537 要承担某人的义务，光是嘴上说两句是不够的。要继承遗产，仅仅获得<i>遗物</ i>是不够的。你父亲的遗产绝不仅仅是物质上的。To take someone's obligations, word is not enough. To come into a legacy, taking the <i>things</i> is not enough. Your 父亲's bequeathal is more than merely material.
6192354999869541 这正是我 <i>不</i> 想承担的。
6192354999869542 我不能够代替他。
6192354999869543 我明白了。
6192354999869540 他的命运。他在金族人中的...地位。在我们心中。 And in our follies.
6192354999869545 我一点也不关心这些问题，我只想找到杀害父亲的凶手。
6192354999869546 所有这些menkhu之谈只是过时的遗物。父亲很喜欢它，是的。但是Kin已经灭绝了。All this menkhu talk is just a relic of a bygone age. 父亲 was fond of it, yes. But the Kin are extinct.
6192354999869547 某位“智者”说过，是吗？我知道这将归结为更多老婆婆的故事。The "wise" say it, yes? I knew it would come down to more old wives' tales.
6192354999869544 他曾经的存在，现在只剩下空虚。谁来填补它？谁能治愈病人？从谎言中辨明真相？谁会......“kharaa”，谁来刨根问底？\ n只有menkhu可以切割身体，只有menkhu才能刺穿未知。谁来制定准则？There is now emptiness where he once was. Who is to fill it? Who will heal the sick? Tell truth from lies? Who will… "kharaa," who will plumb the depths?\nOnly a menkhu can cut a body. Only a menkhu can pierce the unknown. Who will draw the Lines?
6192354999869549 …
6192354999869548 你错了。看看我给你的东西。\n打开udkhar抚摸这些东西。 
6192354999869578 这都是啥...？赛薇，各种蓷薾...草药。他给我留下草药做什么？
6192354999869577 这些东西有看起来眼熟的吗？
6192354999869580 这串名字又是什么？
6192354999869582 你说话的方式与众不同。 远不止是一个普通小镇居民. 我想你是金族人的一员？
6192354999869579 他过去经常制作草药酊剂。酊剂去治愈顽疾...\n他是一个menkhu. 一个连接的知识者。他在加入时看到哪些东西齐声唱。即使你说你不需要这些知识，那就是线条就是这样...... emshen。A knower of connections. He saw which things sing in unison when joined. That's what the Lines are—even if you say you need not this knowledge… emshen.
6192354999869584 也许我的父亲照顾着他们？ 
6192354999869585 我已经认识其中一些孩子了。
6192354999869583 靠近点，让我疲惫的双眼看一下...当地孩子的名字...可汗是对凯恩家小孩的称呼。卡佩拉是老爷的女儿, may he choke on his name. 但我不知道为什么伊西多会列出这个名单。 
6192354999869587 他生命的最后日子，等等。这是个我可以顺藤摸瓜的线索！
6192354999869588 好的。这里的印记又是什么意思？
6192354999869586 Hm… 他对这些孩子格外关注。他生命的最后日子里大部分时间都与他们一起度过。 They followed him, like calves that trailed after a cow, or oxen pulled by a yoke.
6192354999869590 诺克金领导者一个帮派，保管着隐形的宠物。 Mature for his age.
6192354999869591 穆克是个孤儿。她住在铁路旁。
6192354999869592 格蕾丝看管着墓园。 
6192354999869593 奥吉姆斯卡娅是胖维拉德的女儿。虽然她不太像她的父亲。
6192354999869594 史迪奇是个流浪儿。他现在这我这里蹭吃蹭住。
6192354999869589 哪一个？
6192354999869598 名单上还有其他的东西...第八者。某种印记，它也代表着某个孩子吗？ 
6192354999869597 你认为其中一人和他的死亡有关吗？令人怀疑...他们还只是孩子。 不过，孩子们在这个小镇有巨大的力量，即使是真的亦不会让我吃惊...\n但是他们爱他，真的。我不相信。  
6192354999869601 谁能为我破译这个印记？
6192354999869602 Bayarlaa,萨巴. 我现在来继承我的遗产了。
6192354999869600 这是用来标记公牛的烙印。但是金族人的标记有着特殊的含义。\nBe khara,这个是“巫毒”。很难解释...它代表着类似于“庞大的身躯” 或者“特定的身躯” “一个包含许多的身躯”。但我不确定。它也可能只是个印记。
6192354999869604 你指的是什么意思？
6192354999869605 你是不是，又一次在暗示我去追寻父亲的足迹？我不会恶。我要为自己而活。
6192354999869603 我不是你的父亲， kholboön.我不能够教导你。你必须自己去研究。和人交谈。最重要的是，和那些了解你父亲的人交谈。\n这样你才有可能继承你父亲的遗产。
6192354999869607 听起来不错，但是...
6192354999869608 我选择走我自己的道路， khetey.
6192354999869606 在这个地方，你必须通过行动而不仅仅是文字来继承你的遗产。通过向你展示对容器内容物的理解。跟随你父亲的足迹。了解他是谁。找到自己的命运吧。命运就像一个好妻子，爱神。你妻子。In this place, you must come into your legacy through action, not mere words. By showing you understand the contents of the vessel. Follow your 父亲's trails. Learn who he was. Find yourself a fate.\nA fate like a good wife, emshen. Your wife.
6192354999869610 谢谢<i>你。</i>且慢，这些列在纸上的人是谁？
6192354999869609 ……你要继承遗产，emshen。我为你改变；在你的道路上扎根。Khaya dee，…You are to come into your inheritance, emshen. I change for you; take root on your path. Khaya dee, 谢谢你 for this.
6192355001601456 没有你的帮助，我什么都理解不了，无论如何。
6192355001601457 我很抱歉。
6192355001601455 你太鲁莽了，爱神。太急了。我就站在你面前——我可以说你没有正确地打开乌德哈尔，没有触摸里面的物品。You're too rash, emshen. Too hasty. I'm standing right in front of you—I can tell you haven't opened the udkhar properly, haven't touched the items inside.
6192355001601459 父亲为什么给我留下草药？ 
6192355001601460 请阅读这份名单。这些名字是什么？
6192355001601458 Do you need your hand held, like a child? Is that the Line a 布拉克 follows?\nFine. If you don't want to touch it, then listen. In the udkhar, that is now yours, are several blades of various herbs and a piece of paper. On that piece, there's a list of names. I haven't touched it with my eyes.
6192354999869612 你知道他是什么样的人吗？
6192354999869613 让我从你这开始。就他而言，你能告诉我什么？ 
6192354999869611 追随他的足迹， emshen. 你就会了解到他是个什么样的人，和你会成为一个什么样的人。 
6192354999869615 A "menkhu"?
6192354999869616 他受人尊敬是因为他是个医生。
6192354999869614 你的父亲曾是一个menkhu. 他因此受人尊敬。
6192354999869618 什么准则？
6192354999869619 准则，一个哲学概念。就像道或者是 phenomenology…
6192354999869617 他明白准则。
6192354999869621 不要介意。你的对准则的解释是什么？
6192354999869620 “道”是什么？
6192354999869623 父亲以前说准则指的是解剖学。
6192354999869624 万物之间都以某种方式相联系，萨巴。 Hence me pointing out this is a useless philosophy.
6192354999869622 准则代表着事情之间的通道。他们之间的联系。掌管我们生活的法则。\nBetween evil Sky and kind Earth is a Line. The veins of our lifeblood are Lines. A Line carries the inevitable retribution for evil deeds. Family ties, the way children reflect their parents… Those are Lines, too.
6192354999869626 父亲是个医生，不是哲学家。他懂得如何去治疗。 
6192354999869625 万物相连？ 没有伊朗的儿子会说出这种胡言乱语。它传到了我的耳朵里！No son of 伊西多 would utter such drivel. It reaches my ears not! 
6192354999869628 是的。他确实了解这一切。
6192354999869629 我明白了。
6192354999869627 也一样。他知道身体是如何构成的，因为他知道线条。他知道鸡心是如何与一种药草联系在一起的，所以他可以用它来冲泡一种有疗效的茶。他知道一种药草和另一种药草是如何联系的。他知道如何用刀子割尸体，但不会带来伤害。That, as well. He knew how a body is composed because he knew the Lines. He knew how a 肾脏 links to an herb, so he could brew a curative tea from it. He knew how one herb linked to another. He knew how to draw a knife to cut a body, but bring no harm.
6192354999869631 还有其他的吗？
6192354999869632 好的。也因为他是一个公正和有责任心的人。Fine. And also because he was a just and dutiful man.
6192354999869630 不止如此...
6192354999869634 保重。 萨巴. 谢谢你… Bayarlaa. May your kine fatten.
6192354999869635 我的脑袋简直天旋地转......对于今天的我来说已经够了。
6192354999869633 因此，我说只有你追随他的踪迹，才能继承属于你的遗产。做他以前做的事。所有布拉克都是一样的......行动派。\ n我告诉过你我所知道的一切。，emshen。现在走你自己的道路吧。
6192354999869637 And I feel that end is nigh…
6192354999869638 我会将你的话铭记在心，khetey. Douse your eyes.
6192354999869636 现在听我说，emshen，因为我接下来的话至关重要。前几天对你来说是最困难的。 \ n你会发现自己被无数的准则所包围。有些准则你必须打破;而其他的则必须顺从。有些会伤害到你。只有这样，你才能到达终点。
6192355000995064 我将首先考虑你对我提出的挑战。I'll start with thinking hard about the challenge you posed to me.
6192355000995065 我会仔细调查孩子们。他为什么要召集他们？谁是第八者？令人生疑... 
6192355000995063你在计划做什么？你准备从哪开始？
6192355000146934 这些人都是谁， 萨巴? 他们想要什么？
6192355000146935 我的腿不是<i>那个</ i>歪，khetey。My legs aren't <i>that</i> crooked, khetey.
6192355000146933 大地温暖你的根， emshen.
6192355000146937 他们尽问一些奇怪的问题，萨巴。他们找你做什么？
6192355000146938 所以你对金族人来说像是个宗教老师，父亲知道这点吗？
6192355000146936 你瞧，他们尊重我。我不了解准则，但我能感知大地。我代表她和他们说话。他们相信我是泥土做的，就像刹那——艾丹一样，尽管他们并没有这样称呼我。
6192355000146940 什么原罪？
6192355000146943 这些人想干啥？
6192355000146939 …不，我保护他不受伤害。记住：是我爱他。我没有被爱作为回报，因为他后悔我的出现……我提醒他他痛苦的罪过。…No. I shielded him from this. Remember: It was I who loved him. I was not loved in return, for he regretted me coming into being… I reminded him of his bitter sin.
6192355000146942 But what were you shielding him from?
6192355000146946 你知道你在这之中扮演一个什么样的角色吗？
6192355000146941 第一次爆发。你知道我多大了吗？我五年前第一次醒来时，事情发生了。有很多人死了，很多人是我们的人民，哈坦河。粗暴的扩张是一个贫穷的地区。The First Outbreak. Do you know how old I am? I first awoke five years ago, when it happened. There were many dead, and many of the dead were of our people, the Khatanghe. The Crude Sprawl is a poor district.
6192355000146945 我已经和他们说过话了...我猜我把你的工作忙完了。
6192355000149452 他们为什么问我，而不是问你？
6192355000146944 我向这些人传授金族的真相。我重述我们的古老传说。我提醒他们Boddho的意志，世界是如何成为一个身躯。我聆听大地，诉说她的旨意。我要确保他们知道自己来自哪里，要去哪里。\n 病者，弱者需要这个。我们的未来悬一线。 
6192355000146948 所以你们在策划谋反？
6192355000146949 They don't seem angry to me… Confused, perhaps.
6192355000146947 从即将发生的事情开始。哈坦河需要血。\他是个好人。他不需要知道他的人民的愤怒。他自己是如何激起那场愤怒的。他们决不会因为他的所作所为而伤害他；他太受人尊敬了。但他们会把它带到镇上。From what is about to happen. Khatanghe want blood. \nHe was a kind man. He needed not to know of his people's anger. Of how he himself stoked that fury. They would never hurt him for what he had done; he was too venerated. But they will take it out on the Town.
6192355000149451 你这么认为吗？ My answers were not the same you would have given them.
6192355000149453 准则，准则。又是你的人民和准则？额。 自从我小的时候我就受够了这些胡扯。
6192355000146950 我知道这会发生。你做的很好，追随了准则。
6192355000149455 是的，我以前经常抛硬币……在硬币落下之前，我都知道该怎么做，无论哪一面朝上。
6192355000149456 Is that your idea of help?
6192355000149454 他们相信他们是来这里征求意见的。错误。他们早就下定决心了。现在只有他们的软弱在他们身上滋生怀疑，我们才承担那怀疑的重担。不管我们告诉他们什么，他们都会做他们认为正确的事。They believe they come here for advice. False. They have long since made up their minds. Now only their weakness sows doubt in them; we take on the burden of that doubt. Whatever we tell them, they'll do what they think is right.
6192355000149458 你的却是个好老师。
6192355000149459 I'll… give this some thought.
6192355000149460 我不同意，萨巴.
6192355000149457 他们在帮助我们，而不是反过来。问题很重要，而不是答案；对于听众，而不是演讲者。他们有自己的故事，你有自己的故事。这就是准则的真理， tangher。大地的真理
6192355000276252 Khetey, 告诉我这个词的含义：“巫毒” 名单上的印记——来自我继承的遗产。你对此知道什么？
6192355000276253 我在尝试。
6192355000276251 Live without looking forward, emshen.
6192355000276255 例如...?
6192355000276256 所以它可能是个人类。我们每个人身体里都或者成千上万的东西。
6192355000276254 它是...一种由许多其他活物组成的生物。“一个容纳世界的身躯”
6192355000276258 Bos Turokh,公牛的祖先?
6192355000276259 所以，它 <i>是个</i> 人类。
6192355000276257 也许吧，爱神。我不知道这样的事情，我缺乏你的城市知识。许多生物居住在我们身上，就像人们居住在博斯图鲁克一样。我相信。Perhaps, emshen. I know not such things, I lack your city knowledge. Many living beings inhabit us, like people inhabit Bos Turokh. That, I believe.
6192355000276261 Bos Turokh 创造的世界。我记得这个故事。
6192355000276262 连虫人现在都不相信我们生活在一个巨大的公牛上了。
6192355000276260 Bos Turokh, 古老传说中的巨大公牛。他就是大地。 We follow the Lines when we cut up bulls because in his lines, in his nerves and sinews, Bos Turokh encased the knowledge of how the world is connected.\nWhen opening up a body, a butcher reenacts Creation.
6192355000276264 所以你认为“巫毒”就是 Bos Turokh?
6192355000276265 我父亲在他的病人名单中加入了一个巨大的传奇公牛？荒谬至极。
6192355000276263 当然，这是比喻。但是一个美丽，聪明的比喻。把这个世界想象成一个有生命的东西。理解所有事物都与所有其他事物联系在一起，就像身体一样。尊重它就像一个有自己意志的生物。Sure, it's metaphor. But a beautiful, clever metaphor. Think of the world as though it is a living thing. Understand that all things are tied to all other things, just like a body. Respect it like a creature with its own free will.
6192355000276267 这对我完全没有帮助。
6192355000276268 "一个容纳世界的身躯" 实际上可能是指任何东西。
6192355000276269 这会不会是就是金族人对....火车的称呼。一列火车，由许多车厢组成。你知道，挺符合描述的。That's what the Kin might have called, say, a train. A train, made of many cars. The description fits, you know.
6192355000276266 或许。你想一想。你的父亲选择了这个印记，因为你们用的书写语言中，缺乏描绘这种生物的合适单词。一个容纳世界的身躯。一个由许多部分组成的活物。 
6192355000276271 有道理。
6192355000276272 Bayarlaa, 萨巴.这次谈话让我颇受启发。
6192355000276270 他们可能。但与没文化的虫人不同，你的父亲很清楚“火车”这个词。我很怀疑他会把火车当做是需要救赎的生物。
6192355000531252 是你的人民杀死了鲁宾吗？
6192355000531251 你抱着一颗沉重的心而来，esegher.
6192355000531255 所以你的人民与此毫无干系？
6192355000531256 他为什么有罪恶感？
6192355000531254 他的良心杀死了他。他亦是抱着一颗沉重的心而去。它最终裂开了，从他的胸膛滑落。 
6192355000531258 你是在暗示他是自杀吗？我不相信。他绝不是那种人。
6192355000531259 他杀了谁？
6192355000531257 他杀了一个人， 我们成了嫌疑犯。他知道，但没有澄清事实。只是想拖延时间。在我们因他的罪被杀的时候他依然做了他的工作。\n 良心杀死了他。一个足够体面的人。
6192355000531261 你到底对鲁宾做了什么？说啊，ekhene!你知道的！
6192355000531264 我不想为任何人报仇……我们要照看生者，首先。死者必须等待。
6192355000531260 一个大个子。一个坚强的人。一个在他内心承载着整个世界的人。一个肩负着我们镇的人。\n为什么你需要一个名字？你没有足够的担心吗？你不能为你父亲报仇，所以你也得抓住为朋友报仇的机会？
6192355000531263 用眼睛接触，嗯？
6192355000531265 你是组织这一切的人吗？或者说是你的长辈？
6192355000531262 我们的手从未染指他。但眼睛亦可接触。所以我们看着他。让他也看着我们。让他的良心从里面把他吃了。
6192355000531267 你是个无情的女人，萨巴。没有宽恕？
6192355000531268 我更喜欢体力劳动。
6192355000531266 你也可以那么做。你没有试过吗？
6192355000531270 知道。鲁宾的命运就是在那里决定的吗？
6192355000531271 耳朵，是的。我去过那。 
6192355000531269 这跟我有什么关系？我们，Khatanghe，可以一起感知一切。我们没有委员会。我们不下命令。\n 长老们聆听，金族人们行动。沙肯在此苏醒。你听说过那个老村庄吗？
6192355000531273 如果这是真的，你仍是四肢行走的动物。
6192355000531274 你太着急了，不应该那么称呼我。 我不是你的父亲。
6192355000531272 一切都在那里决定。那里的土壤很薄，所以人们可以听到一切。\n搞明白一件事，esegher。只有在你的世界里，人们才能决定谁生谁死。高估自己。我们不思考，我们倾听。一切都是自己发生的。
6192355000531276 我不会，我不一样。
6192355000531277 或许之后，等我变聪明点时会的。
6192355000531278 那地方就是个废墟。我从那没有理解到任何东西。
6192355000531275 想想一群鸟。鸟不给建议，也不说话。他们立刻全力以赴，去他们需要的地方。因为他们知道怎么听。他们不知道自我的概念。他们不畏惧死亡。\n你也会变成那样的。凡来Shekhen的人都明白。
6192355000669952 你的意思是说<i>瘟疫</i> 将会吞噬所有人？
6192355000669951 为了吞噬这个城镇，虫人不必杀死人类。大地将会亲自吞噬一切。
6192355000669958 “当她一息尚存”，嗯？
6192355000830008 所以你把沙疫视作一种自然的力量？
6192355000669957 你知道它们是同一个东西吗？\n 大地是由什么构成的？岩石，树根，水，虫人，瘟疫。没有冬天能克服的力量。你想折磨她就折磨她，当她仍然一息尚存时她就会得到应得的。
6192355000829996 你在这做什么，萨巴?
6192355000829997 我找到了第八者，萨巴。在这地下有一颗心脏在跳动。 
6192355000829995 我从没预料到你会从土胎里爬出来。那么，你也是被地球吐出来的吗？\n像我一样……我们现在会更好地理解彼此，kholboön。
6192355000829999 你什么意思？
6192355000829998 I ready the soil for sowing.
6192355000830001 所以你 <i>确实</i> 想金族反叛，制造屠杀？
6192355000830002 "大地高奏凯歌"?什么意思，
6192355000830000 到金族人吞噬这个小镇的时候了。大地高奏凯歌。小镇将会死亡。\n如果不是现在呢？Unente,大自然会索取本身属于她的东西。 
6192355000830004 小镇。
6192355000830011 大地。
6192355000830003 当然。很高兴它还在跳动。血液仍在血管中流淌。所以谁是第八者？
6192355000830006 为什么？
6192355000830007 Good.
6192355000830005 他们今天想开始。但是有那么多人在沃伦死了……现在士兵们在镇上徘徊，不会发生骚乱。但这并没有改变什么。They wanted to start it today. But so many people died in the Warren… and now 士兵s prowl the Town.\nThere will be no riot. But that changes nothing.
6192355000830010 Uphold 父亲's duty. I accepted it in your presence, remember?
6192355000830016 第八者就是这个小镇。这就是父亲称为巫毒之物。我现在理解了。
6192355000830017 我是金族人的一员， Mother Boddho亦是我的母亲。她可能就是巫毒。
6192355000830009 你现在打算怎么做，kholboön?
6192355000830013 我想...
6192355000830014 不。
6192355000830015 Not all natural things must be endured.
6192355000830012 Yes.
6192355000770362 你怎么了。 khetey?
6192355001440148 In the end, it didn't work out your way. I knew it would hurt you, and I am sorry.
6192355001440149 Don't say that…
6192355000770361 Ukhedel… Earth is cold… My feet are cold… I'm going deaf, blind. My hands are rough. Boleesh, boleesh, byy alysh…
6192355001421878 They fear what they don't understand. Who are you, truly?
6192355001421883 <i>I</i> need you.
6192355001421877 Bou khara, bou shagna… Aydahamni khurene. 我怕大地正在死亡。 Mother Boddho沉入深处。人们开始害怕我。 Look through me. Cross the street to hide from me. No one needs me. No one wants me.
6192355001421880 不要走。
6192355001421886 我很抱歉...
6192355001440150 我不知道我在做些什么！
6192355001651751 是的... 我看见了你的心理反映。
6192355001421879 I am… 萨巴 Usp'tae. Flesh of Earth's flesh. Mother Boddho gave you a piece of herself, so that you may have a mother. That was me. Unente, today I return to Earth. 萨巴 is ubshe… A shabnak tale to frighten children…
6192355001421882 But you can see and hear me just fine, 萨巴. What are you talking about?
6192355001421889 金族人需要你。他们现在属于你了。
6192355001422551 I do!我知道你不相信我，但我需要你！
6192355001421881 Be khara, I shall go blind, deaf. I was part of your journey. Yet you left me by the wayside.\nLet that be so, emshen. I changed for you. Mother Boddho spoke to you through me. But if you need not a mother, then she need not speak to you.
6192355001421885 Is that child you?
6192355001421884 Boleesh, boleesh, byy alysh… When a child is alone, calling Mother, calling 父亲, unable to walk. Can't walk… Unente, all is foreign when you are abandoned.
6192355001421891 Very well… khetey.
6192355001421892 我不相信你！You're human, and you'll remain human. Or become human.
6192355001422451 Bayartay…
6192355001421890 Bou khara, do not watch. Bou shabna, do not listen. Oshysh daa: Go. Please. Bayartay, khybyyn. Khayratay inagni, let your step be warm.
6192355001384860 In the end, it turned out the way you wanted it, huh, 萨巴?
6192355001439758 I thought you were dead.
6192355001439761 Why do you call me that, 萨巴? You're not my mother.
6192355001384859 Be khara, you've done everything right, khybyyn, dear son… Knit together the Town that your 父亲 un拉薇尔ed.\nThe Kin came to power again, threw the Town off its back, left it for Earth to devour. Mother Boddho triumphs, Suok had her harvest. Sated, she now slumbers for a long time…
6192355001438936 Neither did I…
6192355001438935 I wanted less. I never expected… this.
6192355001438938 C'mon. No need to embellish, 萨巴.
6192355001438939 Unente. I did.
6192355001438937 Ene shi yuun khun geeshebshe! Look at me, essegher! How I love you! How I admire you! \nYou are a true emshen, a true knower of the Lines. You chose the path of love. The path of pity. You took pity on us, the weak, the dying, the doomed…
6192355001438941 I am.
6192355001438942 Really, I mean it… There's no need for this.
6192355001438945 I just… wanted to preserve a sliver of the miraculous in this world.
6192355001438940 From their graves, things that had no place in this new world looked at you. Weak, dying, depleted things. Yet you saw life in them! Your gaze revived the unliving. You poured our blood back, returned us our lives, refused to let us be buried.\nGaze at me, emshen!
6192355001438944 够了，萨巴 Usp'tae. Stop it. Temper your rapture.
6192355001438950 I'd like to think that. But the sand pest will return, and will destroy those connections again.
6192355001438943 You came into your 父亲's inheritance, emshen. Following the Lines, drawing the Lines, you wove the Town back into its proper shape, and never betrayed your people.\nWe stared at you mutely. Said our goodbyes. Resigned ourselves to fate. Yet, you never abandoned the weak. Never abandoned us.
6192355001438947 Come now…
6192355001438948 后会有期，某天。
6192355001438949 是的，我走了。再见， 萨巴.
6192355001438946 Oshysh daa, go. I will always watch over you. From beneath Earth's skin, I will watch over you. Wherever I can reach, I will protect you. \nLike Mother Boddho… I shall caress your step.
6192355001439752 I suppose.
6192355001439753 ...我会有个儿子？
6192355001439751 Your son will come then. Wrap it all up after you.
6192355001439755 听起来不错。
6192355001439756 是真的吗？我不知道。
6192355001439757 我不想和父亲沦为一个命运。我不想。
6192355001439754 You already do. And you'll have more. And a daughter. Enough heirs to knit back whatever you un拉薇尔 in your old age.
6192355001439760 Intense.
6192355001439762 Bi oylgono ugyb… 我不明白。
6192355001439759 我从大地而来，亦回归大地。我死了吗？现在，万物永生。
6192354999936851 艾斯佩蒂
6192355001258451 艾斯佩蒂
6192354999869640 布拉克。阿泰米·布拉克.
6192354999869641 你是...？
6192354999869639 有件事很明确了：你非常，非常地走运！这意味着你必须管好你自己！你真是粗心大意，弗拉克。阿泰米·弗拉克，对吗？
6192354999869643 非常强，毫无疑问，正是我的职责将我带回这个破镇子上...
6192354999869644 你为什么这么问？
6192354999869645 布拉克家族的成员一律以职责为要义。
6192354999869642 丹尼尔·丹考夫斯基，医药学者，为你效劳。在我们更深入谈话之前，我必须先弄清一件至关重要的事情：你的职责感多强？
6192354999869647 但是鲁宾在哪？这地方以前是我朋友的家。 
6192354999869646 丹尼尔·丹考夫斯基, 医药学者，为你效劳。 
6192354999869649 什么？为什么？
6192354999869650 但她不仅仅是个朋友，他是我最好的朋友。
6192354999869651 那你究竟在这里做啥，伙计？
6192354999869648 亲爱的伙计，鲁宾不是你的朋友！实际上恰恰相反！任何观察者都可以推断，你假想的见面……几乎没有机会圆满结束。
6192354999869653 我不记得看到过有救援队啊。
6192354999869654 也许某一天我会回报你的好心。
6192354999869652 从此刻开始, 你—ahem—<i>欠我个人情。</i> 我刚刚从可悲的命运中拯救了你！
6192354999869656 什么玩意...？
6192354999869657 等等...我父亲死了？ 
6192354999869655 你的鲁宾虎狼之心。伊西多对他来说非常重要！ 你的父亲是他的导师。鲁宾甚至把他自己当做老布拉克真正的儿子...而不是你\n无论如何，他认为你该为你父亲的死负责。
6192354999869659 ...是的。 我自己也考虑过。
6192354999869660 不，不是。我感觉到你把我从我最好的朋友那里救了出来的勇敢企图充斥着阴谋。
6192354999869661 想让我内疚，是吗？很聪明。你真是个博学的人。
6192354999869658 我试图使他相信不是你杀了伊西多。 Well, not empirically! \n但我有种感觉，在鲁宾心里，仍然是你造成了你父亲的死亡。毕竟，当伊西莫多指望着你的帮助时，你真的花了你宝贵时间来到这里。没错吧？ 
6192354999869663 布拉克。 事情会怎样变得紧张？
6192354999869664 我是一个外科医生。一个好医生。
6192354999869665 我们还没有“明确”我欠你任何东西，伙计。
6192354999869662  听着，我对你的父亲表示哀悼，沃拉克。但既然我们确定你欠我的，让我告诉你你该如何还债。 事情会变得有点紧张，而我只需要一件事：做<i>我让你去做的事。</i> \n你是个医生，对吧？
6192354999869667 ...我不喜欢你这人，学者，无论如何。 
6192354999869666 今天的悲剧绝不会是最后一个。我有幸拥有天生的高智商，我的观察表明一个非常致命的访客来到了这个被上帝遗弃的小镇。\n我现在只能说了。
6192354999869669 请你把嘴巴闭上如何？我会自己处理鲁宾的问题。不需要中间人插手。他在哪？ 
6192354999869670 我受够了这种愚蠢的语言。我姑且假设这是个道歉。
6192354999869671 我得先确定你是不是好人。现在，再见。
6192354999869668 允许我总结一下，鲁宾告诉我他是镇子上唯一一个正式医生，但是你是一个称职的外科医生！我需要你或者，健康安静地或者。在附近。 \别让我胡思乱想了，我会是掌管大局之人。 Medicum morbo adhibere.
6192354999869673 ...我不喜欢你这人，学者，无论如何。 
6192354999869674 Amaa tat, khonzohon, as goes the local one.
6192354999869672 Qui habet aures, audiat… As the saying goes.
6192354999869676 不...
6192354999869677 谎言！你说慌！
6192354999869675 噢，他昨晚被杀的。你不知道吗？
6192354999869679 但是鲁宾 <i>是</i> 我的朋友。
6192354999869680 这很困难吗？
6192354999869678 哦，我很怀疑。我比你更谨慎。而且细心。并且留意。例如，我设法与鲁宾建立友好关系，你所谓的朋友。
6192354999869682 我非常讨厌大城市的花花公子，认为自己无所不知。
6192354999869683 我的行为出自我的责任感，其次是我的固执。我建议用你的高智商做点有用的事，别挡我的路，学者。
6192354999869681 按我的指令行事！从现在起，我让你的鲁宾做什么他就会做什么。他为我服务完全出于自愿。\n我建议你也这么做，这对每个人都有好处。
6192354999869685 我没有兴趣对陌生人推心置腹。特别是他们连我名字都记不住的时候。 
6192354999869686 三个。
6192354999869688 你是个侦探吗？
6192354999869684 失礼了。容我询问...你的行为真的导致了四个人的死亡吗？ 
6192354999869690 你老人家究竟是谁，伙计？
6192354999869689 如我所料。
6192354999869692 外面的孩子告诉我他们有三个朋友半只脚踏入鬼门关...而你拒绝提供帮助。
6192354999869691 回来的很快啊，布拉克? 我希望你能好好解释一下。
6192354999869694 "更重要的事"? 你宣誓了——现在履行你的职责！
6192354999869695 "杂种狗"呵呵？好吧，现在我知道你的立场了。如果我的手没有那么疼的话，我会打断你的下巴的，伙计…
6192354999869693 亲爱的老兄，这听起来像是你的专长领域。欢迎你向他们提供你的服务！比起浪费时间在一群杂种狗上，我有更重要的事去做。 I have better things to do than waste my time on a bunch of mangy mutts.
6192354999869697 不，但我确实有<i>颗</i> 心，至少。 
6192354999869698 离开这个小镇，学者。没有你我们会过得更好。
6192354999869696 你真是好心，布拉克.
6192354999869700 我不是在浪费你的时间！
6192354999869701 看来我们对职责有不同的理解。
6192354999869699 我的职责完全不同。如果你再浪费我的时间，我可以会无法去完成它。 
6192354999869703 错误的问题。 <i>你</i> 为什么在这里?
6192354999869704 我住在这。
6192354999869705 你真的想知道吗？
6192354999869702 你为什么会在这？
6192354999869707 让我猜猜。你是把它封锁的那个人？
6192354999869708 没错。
6192354999869706 十分不幸，这个房子被封锁了。我很抱歉，布拉克… <i>是</i> 布拉克没错吧？
6192354999869710 你不会喜欢里面的。
6192354999869711 待人接客是我们家族的重要传统。但是对你，我拒绝。
6192354999869709 好吧，我是来做卫生检查工作的。 所以我来检查并隔离这里。
6192354999869713 我在检查我父亲的死亡现场。
6192354999869714 这是我的房子。
6192354999869715 只是确保没有人...在附近打探。
6192354999869712 我愿意这么做，是的。
6192354999869717 我不喜欢你，学者。
6192354999869718 现在可不是时候。
6192354999869716 为什么？
6192354999869720 给我消失。
6192354999869719 丹尼尔·丹考夫斯基，为你效劳。 
6192354999869722 放屁。
6192354999869721 错，现在正是关键时候。事实上我想说这个房子必须被马上封锁。分秒必争。
6192354999869724 里面不太整洁。
6192354999869725 里面的空气...不太健康。可能会刺激到你的肌肤。
6192354999869726 里面有些不对劲。
6192354999869727 因为这是我的房子，我不允许你进去。
6192354999869723 真的？为什么？
6192354999869729 你给我见鬼去吧，你想做什么就做什么。
6192354999869730 我警告你。
6192354999869731 那就进去吧。检查这块地方。如果你可以解释里面发生了什么，请也告诉我一声。
6192354999869728 是这样吗？不过，在您的好意批准下，我还是坚持要检查一下这个地方。\你就散你不允许也是。但如果你努力阻碍我，我也会做得很好。我希望我不需要用枪威胁你？
6192354999869733 我父亲的遗体在哪？
6192354999869734 "为了最好"? <i>是为了</i>你吧！这是<i>我的</i> 房子，你这个傻屌花花公子，还有...
6192354999869732 是的，我承担了这个责任的不幸负担。但是，放轻松！这都是为了最好。
6192354999869736 ...我现在去哪？
6192355000025560 草泥马。
6192354999869735 我没听说过。
6192354999869738 ...我现在去哪？
6192355000394651 草泥马。
6192354999869737 然而，由于我目前不能向你透露的原因，这所房子仍处于临时隔离状态。
6192354999869740 那真了不起，我猜。
6192354999869741 I could definitely use a roof over my head…
6192354999869739 好吧，看看这些。我在里面找到一些文件和一把钥匙。我想他们现在属于你了。希望这些文件能解释钥匙是怎么开锁的。
6192355001109614 不知道。以前从来没见过。
6192355001109617 什么霉菌，你究竟在说些什么？
6192355001109618 它们是痣。我在这附近见过更奇怪的东西。
6192355001109613 顺便问一下，这个奇怪的……霉菌是什么？是霉菌吗？你房子里的长满了这种东西？附近房子都会有痂吗？
6192355001109616 不知道。以前从来没见过。
6192355001109619 什么霉菌，你究竟在说些什么？
6192355001109620 它们是痣。我在这附近见过更奇怪的东西。
6192355001109615 顺便问一下，这个奇怪的……霉菌是什么？是霉菌吗？你房子里的长满了这种东西？ 附近房子都会有痂吗？
6192354999972256 为什么要那么多？
6192355000004105 我也不是挖掘者，我是个一个外科医生。
6192354999972255 我需要五十个头脑清醒的人，拿着铁锹。我知道，这是一个很高的要求。\n你的城市史前垃圾场里，不应该混有各种各样的东西和常识。我能应付五十个铁锹，但召集一打有思想的人是不可能的。要么就是那样，要么他们挖不到。像我一样。
6192354999972258 接待新客人？什么意思？ 
6192354999972261 A man of vision, then. Way to go, emshen.
6192354999972257 我需要解决集体墓穴的问题，毕其功于一役。\n 哦，我们需要选择城镇的哪个部分作为新的墓园。因为老的墓园现在拒绝招待新的客人。
6192354999972260 我认识她。她叫格蕾丝。
6192354999972262 什么困扰到她？
6192354999972259 你知道谁管理墓地吗？一个未成年人。 萨普洛夫分配给我的帮手——<i>我的帮手，<i>我要着重强调，部下——停止工作，只是因为有些事情困扰到那个女孩。\n 我开始认为脑萎缩才是这个城市真正的死亡原因。
6192354999972264 Cremation?
6192355000004106 Digging is not exactly popular here. Living earth cult. Nothing but the graveyard will do.
6192355000004107 你自己说的，emshen。一个建在在市中心的新墓园。等你回首都你可以讲好好吹一下。
6192354999972263 我真的不在乎。重要的是，我们现在没有地方埋葬死者。看法？毕竟，你是本地人。
6192354999972266 Look, I can't make heads or tails of what you want from <i>me.</i>
6192354999972267 I'll see what I can do.
6192354999972265 对极了，布拉克，\n如果早上的报告可信的话，工厂的炉子足够大，可以解决我们的小问题。但是当地人拒绝焚烧死者。如果我们慷慨地把他们的胡言乱语称为“争论”，那么归根结底就是指那个精神错乱的女孩。
6192355000004109 烧掉尸体。
6192355000004110 Stop the epidemic. That solves everything.
6192355000004108 很有趣，布拉克。不过，玩笑开够了……现在我真的要考虑解决这个问题了。
6192355000948775 Wait, emshen. Don't bother the girl. Perhaps I can talk sense into her.
6192355001452761 You do that. It's… tough for her in the cemetery.
6192355001452762 …I wonder if <i>you're</i> the threat looming over her, emshen. Don't be rash. Let me talk to her.
6192355000948774 From you? Oh, nothing. I was just sharing.\nFrom the local authorities, though, I want a lot. I want them to make sure that the burial business is supervised by someone a bit older than fifteen, and far more rational! I'll make sure it happens!
6192355001452754 "She"? You mean the 审判官?
6192355001452757 What's wrong with our corpses?
6192355001452758 This isn't the first time you've had to manage the Town's business, oynon. You're good at it.
6192355001452753 I have to admit, this is the last thing I expected. I'm dead weight to her. I expected respect, or maybe <i>loathing,</i> but… she takes me for a useless dreamer. Assigned me to take care of the Town's corpses, instead of any other thing I could be doing!\nNo matter. Someone needs to do this job, too. A doctor can't shy away from dirty work.
6192355001452760 What does she want you to do?
6192355001452759 Yes.
6192355000202694 This was ugly of you.
6192355000202695 I understand. Forget it.
6192355000202696 You shouldn't have started the meeting without me.
6192355000202693 布拉克. The situation is regretful. I just didn't have time to warn you.
6192355000202698 Shoot.
6192355000202699 我们在浪费时间。
6192355000202700 …Wait a second, you mean the girl in the wool cap, with needles for eyes?
6192355000202697 Well, let's get down to business. We have three doctors in town. Four, if we count the deranged girl who claims to have a healing touch—rubbish, of course. But she has a lot of energy, and she knows a thing or two, so it won't hurt to let her work. \nAnd 布拉克, allow me to be frank?
6192355000202702 I don't have a degree.
6192355000202703 I'm 一个外科医生。 And a damn good one.
6192355000202704 Medical school.
6192355000202701 Where did you graduate? What are your qualifications? Do you have a degree?
6192355000202706 Vaccines aren't my area of expertise.
6192355000202707 A vaccine? We wouldn't finish that until after the whole town is extinct. But what an amazing breakthrough for your resume, right?
6192355000202708 A vaccine is something you create for the future, not for people who are sick now! You just want to protect your buddies in the Capital if the plague spreads, huh?
6192355000202705 布拉克, I want you to become my aide. Our primary goal is developing a vaccine. You're a local, and… enterprising. I need your help.
6192355000202710 I'll think of something. I won't let you just give up on the sick.
6192355000202711 How can you know that? You weren't here five years ago. You weren't here five days ago!
6192355000202712 Just say it. What do you want from me?
6192355000202709 Other towns like this one exist, you know. \nIf this disease is half as lethal as the outbreak five years ago, this place is doomed. Other people can still be saved. Or perhaps you have better suggestions?
6192355000202714 Perhaps I'll drop by… if I have the time.
6192355000202715 No deal. I am responsible for my actions, no one else. Family tradition.
6192355000202713 I will make the vaccine, but I can't do it without you. All you need to do is be at hand and do as I say. I will take full responsibility for the situation.
6192355000202717 I need to find a way to… save people.
6192355000219951 I don't know yet.
6192355000202716 So what do you have in mind, 布拉克?
6192355000202720 Familiarity breeds affection. I'm sure you'll grow to appreciate it.
6192355000202721 Yes, I wasn't here for the First Outbreak. But this is my hometown.
6192355000202719 Neither were you. But I've been collecting evidence—since yesterday, when you were dashing around the steppe. My explorations have actually been successful. \nAnd mind your tone, 布拉克. I don't take kindly to rudeness.
6192355000202723 My goal is survival. We're each on our own, emshen.
6192355000202724 A worldwide… huh. You're pretty honest about your ambitions, aren't you?
6192355000202725 That's your goal. Mine is to protect my hometown.
6192355000202722 They are mine. Our goal is to stall the epidemic… and prevent a worldwide pandemic.
6192355000202727 We have… but it doesn't matter.
6192355000202728 Don't ever let her close to you! We… we don't need her.
6192355000202729 Forget her. What did you want to talk about?
6192355000202726 Yes… I guess she wears a cap. And she does have… a presence. You've met?
6192355000202734 I'd rather take care of those who are already suffering.
6192355000202735 Go to hell, emshen.
6192355000202733 Think about it. A curative serum for an unknown disease? This contagious, and this lethal? On such short notice? What a utopian thought. \nA vaccine, on the other hand, can protect the healthy—the people who still have a chance.
6192355000202737 So what?
6192355000202738 We don't know what really happened during that outbreak!
6192355000202736 And you're calling me ambitious? If this is the same disease that broke out here five years ago, then plague is like mumps compared to it!
6192355000223952 It is a dead end, erdem. I've tried all the obvious components, but none of them work.
6192355000223980 Accepting that one is lost… That's a breakthrough all on its own.
6192355000223951 It's hard to admit, but I think arrogance is my undoing. This damn microbe is a shapeshifter, a proteus. It eludes me. The vaccine doesn't work. 布拉克, this is a dead end.
6192355000223954 Hm… A sickness like this needs unique antibodies. What kind of creature could produce them?
6192355000223967 This cure… It needs some sort of special tissue. It needs to be more than human…
6192355000223968 There are more kinds of life in the world than it seems at first glance… Could this be the answer?
6192355000223953 I have extracted a microbial culture. I weakened it—it's doable even without all the tools I'm used to.\nBut it's ever-changing! Like a person first sick with pox, then with cholera, then with typhoid fever! What do I do?
6192355000223970 But who says that this creature is beyond reach? Human or not… Who cares.
6192355000223971 It's not even about immunity. The tissue must fight back, not defend… <i>overcome</i> the enemy, not just protect itself!
6192355000223975 When something fights back… that's not a rejection, that's something else. Yes… the answer must be close…
6192355000223969 And yet, there is a wholeness to this disease. There must be some commonality between all those heinous shapes. What do they share? If I understand that, I could catch it by the tail! The answer must be so close…
6192355000223973 The scientific method… no. Hand-me-down answers won't help me here.
6192355000223974 Searching for answers in one's specialty… in the fields one has unique access to… Hmm…
6192355000223976 Thinking outside the box… Yes! That's the approach this problem needs!
6192355000223972 The scientific method has never failed me. I've always walked the path it showed me. But science is… a minx. You need to keep her fascinated, to change yourself, invent new things. I need to think outside the box…
6192355000223978 Correct. When you're at a dead end, perhaps what you need is to rise upwards.
6192355000223979 Yes. When it seems like a dead end, that might be an illusion. Just walk through walls.
6192355000223977 …Which means that I need to approach the problem from a very unusual angle. But it's challenging. The fuller one's memory, the more active the brain, the more limits it imposes upon itself.
6192355000378452 I guess.
6192355000378453 You look exhausted, erdem. Get some sleep. Twyre is in bloom.
6192355000378451 No vaccine yet… Another fruitless attempt. But there must be a solution to this problem! There must!
6192355000378455 Is he, I wonder?
6192355000378458 I will if I get a chance. It's like he has a death wish.
6192355000378454 Tell that to 鲁宾. He doesn't sleep at all—though, he's well aware of that twyre of yours.
6192355000378457 I got something. Bulls can't get infected.
6192355000378951 None.
6192355000378456 Anyway, how's it going? Any progress?
6192355000378953 Here, take a look. A sample of bull blood.
6192355000378954 No, I don't.
6192355000378955 If you get a new one, have it guarded.
6192355001200378 Funny, I had something similar happen. Lost the whole bull…
6192355000378952 The whole bull thing… I had one delivered to me. I injected it with a strain, intending to collect a blood sample the next day. But the beast disappeared in the night! Any idea who could be behind it?
6192355000378957 Sometimes. A bit.
6192355000378961 No. It's just that you have experience with this. You're a scientist. I'm 一个外科医生。
6192355000378956 …Are you a mind reader?
6192355000378959 And?
6192355000378960 No, I'm not sure. That's why I came to you.
6192355000378958 Are you sure? I had the same line of thinking. At least that's the first thing I checked.
6192355000378963 I can't. I have a lot on my plate. I'll just drop by later.
6192355000378964 All right. Thanks, erdem.
6192355000378962 Leave it with me, I'll study it. Will only take a few hours. While I'm busy, you may hit the cot over there, by the folding screen. You need it. I've seen corpses prettier than you.
6192355001200382 I can genuinely help you, erdem. Examine this. It's bull blood.
6192355001200381 Damn this town… I feel I'm trapped in a nightmare. The absurdity of it all… There's no one to talk to. Everyone's so volatile.\nThey all seem to want to help, but… their help is worse than hostility.
6192355001200384 I can't. I have a lot on my plate. I'll just drop by later.
6192355001200386 All right. Thanks, erdem.
6192355001200383 Leave it with me, I'll study it. Will only take a few hours. In that time, I suggest you hit the cot somewhere. I've seen corpses prettier than you.
6192355000378966 Why is that?
6192355000378979 So bulls are indeed immune to sand pest?
6192355000378965 Well, seems like you were right. But it's of no use to either of us.
6192355000378968 Tell me more.
6192355000378980 Maybe to you, erdem. Not to me.
6192355000378967 Indeed, they produce antibodies. A lot of them. But they're useless to us.
6192355000378970 No.
6192355000378971 Say it once more, slowly.
6192355000378972 We didn't learn that in any of my courses.
6192355000378969 How well are you versed in raw sample hyperimmunization for xenogeneic serums? Do you know how immunoglobulins are extracted from a native serum?
6192355000378974 But?
6192355000378981 Of no interest, you say? …Wait a second!
6192355000378973 Sand pest evolves and mutates in human blood. Fast. It doesn't do that in bulls. It's as though bulls are of no interest to it. But their antibodies <i>could</i> theoretically be useful…
6192355000378976 …A minotaur. A creature that combines man and bull.
6192355000378977 You want me to wait while you find a way to weaken the disease? No way.
6192355000378978 So it's a dead end. I see. Thanks, erdem.
6192355000378975 Unless the disease is weakened, we can't inject a person with those antibodies. It's too risky. Children, for example, definitely wouldn't survive the procedure. We're too different from bulls.\nMeaning what we need is…
6192355000378983 No, nothing. Just thinking…
6192355000378982 What?
6192355000734052 How should I know?
6192355000734053 This is 格蕾丝. She's the cemetery caretaker.
6192355000734057 Where's that… artist?
6192355000734051 What is this girl doing here?
6192355000734055 I do.
6192355000734056 I don't.
6192355000734054 Forget it. Do you have any immunity boosters?
6192355000734059 Damn it! Why do they keep going outside? Do they want to get infected?
6192355000734058 He's an architect, and I have no idea. I came here for him, not the girl…
6192355000734061 I know. I'll take care of her.
6192355000734060 She needs medicine. In an infected district, everyone's in danger. Immunity boosters can help.
6192355000745265 Did <i>you</i> do it?
6192355001338051 That was my line, emshen.
6192355001338052 Spare me, oynon. Don't pretend you haven't done all those things.
6192355000745264 I think… all these plague days have been leading to me doing something like this.\nI've been accused of all sorts of crimes—but I was innocent. There were rumors that I was a looter, that I walked around with a revolver killing people. I guess… I had to prove them right.
6192355001338054 What for?
6192355001338057 He was delivering 阿格莱雅's papers to the 士兵s. Her orders.
6192355001338053 Yes.
6192355001338056 And?
6192355001499763 You are mistaken, oynon. There's dissent among the 士兵s. If the orders are not delivered, there will be no bombardment at all.
6192355001338055 The Army is leaving, dragging their ungodly cannons with them. The general needs to make one final shot. He is loathe to shoot people, but <i>something</i> must be destroyed.
6192355001338059 Then why…
6192355001338060 Heady indeed.
6192355001338058 Exactly. And he would have done it, too. Stubborn. Devoted. Selfless. Like all of us… September is heady this year, as you people like to say.
6192355001338062 Does it matter, emshen? We've known each other for a week. You've got blood on your hands. So do I.
6192355001338063 No.
6192355001338064 First, tell me why. Then I'll think.
6192355001338061 Do you condemn me?
6192355001338066 You would know, oynon. Shifting the boundary between death and life is, like, your whole shtick, isn't it?
6192355001338067 Why did you kill him?
6192355001338065 I won't let them shoot the Polyhedron. I'll do anything within my power to stop it. It's the only living thing around here, if you think about it.
6192355001338069 Well… she's good at convincing people.
6192355001338085 Frightened him, of course. What else?
6192355001338068 I tried to ask him nicely, but he wouldn't give me the papers. A zealot. I wonder what she did to him…
6192355001338071 文件在哪？
6192355001338070 Why are you here?
6192355001338073 I have my own plans for my hometown.
6192355001338074 I want to keep them. As a memory of the commissar.
6192355001338072 Why do you want them?
6192355001338076 I would have.
6192355001338077 Unlike you, I don't kill people for papers.
6192355001338078 But 为什么？ Why burn them?
6192355001338075 See the ashes over there, on the floor? Barely managed to do it before you arrived. Smart of me to burn them rather than eat them, I think. You're a surgeon—you would have dug it all out of my gut.
6192355001338080 So what shall we do now?
6192355001338079 没有文件，就没有炮击。The mutiny is doomed—most of the 士兵s adore their general. \nAnd Block, like me, is a man of formality. He wouldn't waste ammo without proof.
6192355001338082 
6192355001338081 
6192355001338084 Mind your tongue, oynon.
6192355001338086 Three hundred years? It's much older. Several thousand, maybe. The屠宰场 has been its head since time immemorial.
6192355001338089 Why do you care so much? The Tower is deranged. It's lunacy.
6192355001338083 This tower is the only valuable thing around here. Perhaps all three hundred years of this wretched town's history happened just so that this flower could bloom atop this pile of shit.
6192355001338088 What for?
6192355001338087 Once, maybe, but now the屠宰场 has become the Town's putrid ass. The head is elsewhere. That head is what we must preserve.
6192355001338091 I don't think so.
6192355001338097 我听说它被政府给关闭了。
6192355001338090 I'll tell you. I will—the way I'd tell a close, intimate friend. Have I ever told you about my Thanatica?
6192355001338094 Were you successful?
6192355001338098 Big words indeed.
6192355001338093 Then listen.\nI had a lab in the Capital. We studied the dynamics and progression of death. If you pardon the big words, we tried to defeat it. Or at least figure it out enough that people could decide for themselves whether their time has come—or not.
6192355001338096 So in order to defeat death, it must be preserved?
6192355001338099 I don't care about the outside world. We have to sacrifice the Tower so that my town can live—and give birth to more towers like this one in the future. You hear me, emshen?
6192355001338095 I can't share the details. We don't have time. And anyway—you'd have to be me, and live there two weeks with my head on your shoulders to notice and realize all that I have.\nTrust me. Destroying the Tower would delay our triumph over death indefinitely.
6192355001338101 You heard me loud and clear.
6192355001338102 I may be myopic, yes. I'm always thinking with my heart… or my hands.
6192355001338100 I hear you. Loud and clear. But you're an idiot, 阿泰米 布拉克. A skilled surgeon, maybe, but a lousy doctor. \nAnd a terrible player, as well. You waste your final move sucking the poison from the wound, when you could have strangled the snake once and for all.
6192355001338104 I understand, oynon. I'll think about what you said.
6192355001338105 No. I can see that you believe what you say, but you haven't convinced me.
6192355001338103 Precisely.
6192355001499765 We'll see about that.
6192355001499766 But killing a person…
6192355001499764 So there won't be.
6192355000770376 I understand it's hard for you.
6192355001428753 …
6192355000770375 And not just mine. Back in Thanatica, we fought for life. For the right to live. For a chance to… to never let death <i>veto</i> people. That's what we were robbed of.\nThis tower… Ah, what is there to say. It's gone. And so is hope.
6192355001236845 
6192355001236844 
6192355001236847 
6192355001236846 
6192355001428755 You've aged over these last few days. Or are you just resigned, now?
6192355001439822 There is no death.
6192355001428754 A scientist, thrown into the jaws of Death, hoping against hope to defeat Death. Welcomed by Death, ridiculed by Death, taunted by Death, and… fooled by Death.\nIt's as if this heretic spat into a tower of flame, expecting, somehow, to put it out. This whole place is far too crowded with Deaths.
6192355001428757 I told you already… I don't speak that barbaric tongue.
6192355001428758 Nookherni… Nүnehen zayla. It'll be fine.
6192355001439823 Stay here. A new tower will grow, just you wait. I say this as… a friend.
6192355001428756 Imperare sibi maximum imperium est.
6192355001439806 Oynon.
6192355001439807 Erdem.
6192355001439810 学者。
6192355001439805 Emshen.
6192355001439809 Not exactly. You need to swallow the vowels, like you can't open your mouth… Oh, forget it.
6192355001439811 You did.
6192355001439814 Just call me by name. We don't want you to break your jaw.
6192355001439808 Did I say it right? "Emshen"?
6192355001439813 This is it, erdem.
6192355001439817 It's just the beginning, oynon.
6192355001439812 Well… this is it, I guess.
6192355001439816 Cost you your life? Come now.
6192355001439818 Did someone send you here? I thought you came on your own accord.
6192355001439815 This pursuit of immortality will cost me my life. I doubt the Powers That Be in the Capital ever cared whether or not I could defeat death. They just threw the heretic into the fire, hoping he'd never return. Excuse the pathos.
6192355001439820 So… Cheers, I guess?
6192355001439821 …
6192355001439819 Yeah… You're right, I'm confused. I haven't been so drunk since my student years. Then again, it's hard to knock a doctor off their feet. I can still think, just… not straight.
6192355000841352 But it's a single space. No separate rooms.
6192355001236836 They say you can tell who's infected immediately. That it shows.
6192355000841351 We need an isolation ward. A huge building—"spacious," yes, that's the word I used. The 凯恩s suggested the Cathedral. That's it. Nothing surprises me anymore.\nThen again, all a quarantined person has left is prayer.
6192355001236835 You should suggest that to the 凯恩s, erdem. They'll appreciate your imagination. Building one's spirit, training their will, asking the perennial questions…
6192355001236834 Precisely. No separate rooms. No running water. No heat. No beds. \nAnd yes, it is spacious—vertically! I suppose Victor expects me to build eight-story bunk beds there? And add hanging ropes so that people from the upper layers can descend to the toilet?
6192355001236838 I'm sorry.
6192355001236843 An oak isn't felled in one stroke.
6192355001236837 We don't know anything for certain yet… anything! The vaccine is a disaster… People are dropping like flies… Not a single patient recovered. Not a single one!
6192355001236840 I have a question for you too, erdem.
6192355001236850 All right. I'll leave you to it. Although, I think we're better off without an isolation ward at all.
6192355001236839 Questions, questions, questions… Always questions, never answers.
6192355001236849 No. It's a polite way to address a person of knowledge.
6192355001241451 "Erdem," "oynon," and "emshen" are the words people use for doctors.
6192355001241452 Sort of.
6192355001236848 By the way, what does "erdem" mean? Obviously it's a steppe word, but what's the translation? "Arrogant fool," maybe?
6192355001241454 Okay, don't laugh at me. Have you heard that five years ago, during the First Outbreak, kids made these—
6192355001241453 So?
6192355001241456 Holy shit… Sorry, excuse my language. So you've checked, then?
6192355001241457 I'm no erdem. "Emshen" would be more accurate… but not especially humble. Usually, we call surgeons "yargachins," as in butchers.
6192355001241455 —horrible mixtures from ground pills, yes. "Shmowders." They can cure the plague.\nYes… I've heard. Worse, I've checked. So don't laugh at me either, dear colleague. What's the word… "erdem"?
6192355001241459 Fair enough.
6192355001241463 Pity. I wondered how that was possible… Thought you might know.
6192355001241458 You don't have to watch your tongue with me. Yes, I've checked. But if you wonder how it works, I don't know. I'm not a pharmacologist, and anyway, this place doesn't have a lab. If you ask me, it was ten thousand monkeys at a typewriter… Oh, I don't want to delve too deep into this. "There are more things in heaven and earth…"\nWhat we need is a process that follows the scientific method.
6192355001241461 Godspeed, oynon.
6192355001241462 If we meet again, that is.
6192355001241460 All right, 布拉克. Now's not the time for steppe linguistics… We'll talk later, colleague.
6192355001173158 What's this, then?
6192355001173159 Good. Without water, we're done for.
6192355001173157 Colleague, this is nonsense. You're stuck in the Middle Ages… I suppose I just have to accept this.\nWhenever an outbreak strikes, the rumor mill spins its wheels. Someone poisoned the wells! Who? Gypsies, heathens, witches, foreigners… I won't act without proof. Which doesn't exist.
6192355001173161 Damn it… 劳拉!
6192355001173162 Great. So I robbed half the Town of water with my own hands.
6192355001173160 No ifs. Consider it infected. Then… Well, it's not like I have a choice! We'll follow the plan and destroy all the water barrels in the Middle Town. Effective immediately. We simply can't take any risks here.\nI can't shake this sense of dread… As if fate itself acts against us.
6192355001251661 What's going on with the water, emshen?
6192355001251662 Why are the water barrels being guarded?
6192355001251660 Yes, 布拉克?
6192355001251664 But what if we do find an infected barrel?
6192355001251695 Fewer.
6192355001251663 One well-wisher came here today, reporting that someone infected the water barrels in the Middle Town.\nCertainly, it'd be nice to investigate. But when am I supposed to do that? How many barrels are in that area? Twenty? Thirty?
6192355001251666 Why only the Middle Town?
6192355001251697 But you could check them.
6192355001251665 Overriding my authority, 萨普洛夫 issued an order: All barrels in the Middle Town are to be destroyed. Those are his people guarding them… And, well, I'm powerless to challenge his orders.
6192355001251668 But I thought…
6192355001251698 But what if it's true?
6192355001251667 I've received samples from the Upper and Lower Town. All clear.\nAnd the Middle Town is clear, too! It's all nonsense. An idiotic craze, a crowd mad with paranoia! I have too much to do to go chasing shadows…
6192355001251670 The issue with the water keeps bothering me…
6192355001251681 Yup. That's my name.
6192355001251669 布拉克.
6192355001251672 …And if it's infected?
6192355001251671 No. No… For god's sake… Damn it! What have we done to deserve…\n…All right. I apologize for that outburst. Leave it to me. I'll examine it. Today… It won't take long.
6192355001251674 No… Nothing.
6192355001251677 I made a mistake. But it's my concern, not yours.
6192355001251673 What?
6192355001251679 Something's wrong with this water.
6192355001251680 From a barrel in the Middle Town.
6192355001251678 What's this? Where did you get it?
6192355001251683 As in…?
6192355001251684 I know that. But what's the plan?
6192355001251682 And a grave one.
6192355001251687 Quite. Still, erdem, about the water…
6192355001251688 It'll take them roughly three days to fetch the water.
6192355001251686 "Water carriers"? Seriously, 布拉克? We're quarantined! Although, I suppose we'll have to send someone—with proper security, of course…\nWhere, by the way, are those springs? Far from here?
6192355001251690 So those guards simply protect the barrels from the common people? To stop them from taking too much?
6192355001251691 There is talk of infected barrels…
6192355001251694 There are steppe springs. Water carriers bring water from there.
6192355001251689 Water will now be given to people drop by drop, in a controlled fashion.\nSome luddites destroyed your water pipes tonight. Claimed it was contaminated by the river water. Granted, the Gorkhon <i>is</i> terribly polluted… but what if there was no contamination? Where are we supposed to get water now? For sanitary use, if nothing else…
6192355001251693 Who started the rumor?
6192355001251692 Drivel. I don't believe it for a second.
6192355001243852 We managed somehow. And no one complained.
6192355001251651 Can I help you somehow?
6192355001243851 We need to set up the facilities… An isolation ward, a real hospital… We need control over corpse disposal…\nTell me, how's it possible this town has never had a proper hospital? Don't women give birth here? Don't people get sick? I'm serious…
6192355001251654 I don't know. We didn't have all this infrastructure back when I left. All the water was brought in from steppe springs.
6192355001251655 Gorkhon water is unsuitable for drinking. The屠宰场's too close.
6192355001251656 Why do you ask?
6192355001251653 No. Not now…\nThough, can you tell me what's going on with your water delivery system? Is it true the water's only for industrial purposes? Seriously…
6192355001251658 Fair enough. Good luck, emshen.
6192355001251659 Be oylgono үgyb…
6192355001251657 No reason… Hopefully those are only silly rumors.\nForget it, 布拉克. I have a splitting headache. If you have no urgent business, then we'll talk later. Later, later… Qui non proficit, deficit.
6192355001288964 What's wrong with you, emshen?
6192355001420254 Tenegh…
6192355001288963 Totum revolutum. "TO-tum re-vo-LU-tum." No… Damn it… "re-VO-lu-tum"…
6192355001420256 Enunciate that "ski" more crisply, maybe?
6192355001420257 I never thought you… rehearsed all that.
6192355001420255 Hush, you'll destroy my focus. Scientia potentia est. "Ski-EN-ti-a"…
6192355001390852 You're a disgace, oynon.
6192355001403690 你害怕了不是吗？我可以从你的眼神里看出来。
6192355001403691 Me too.
6192355001390851 Hey… I don't know what to do. I'm at a loss.
6192355001403693 A church investigation.
6192355001403694 I've heard about it.
6192355001403692 Do you know what the inquisition is?
6192355001403697 
6192355001403698 
6192355001403696 
6192355001403700 你害怕吗？
6192355001403701 I mean, this whole situation falls in their department. There's an outbreak. We're all dying. What else is there to do?
6192355001403699 What the hell are you talking about, 布拉克? What church? This isn't funny!
6192355001403703 Arrogant as always, oynon. You're not the only person responsible.
6192355001403704 You've done a lot.
6192355001403702 I carry this cross willingly. I found myself in your damn town by accident. When hell broke loose… I tried. I tried to fight this wretched plague! I took responsibility, I did everything I should have. Do you understand?
6192355001403706 Yes.
6192355001403707 No.
6192355001403708 Any choice is right, so long as it's willed.
6192355001403705 The 审判官 will take the one who bends reality. They'll twist them, break them. The person responsible won't even understand how they decided to put a bullet in their own head. That's their method.\nDo you consider yourself free, 布拉克?
6192355001403710 I don't imagine them. They don't exist.
6192355001403711 Chubby cherubs with wings and golden curls. 为什么？
6192355001403712 Why even ask? You don't believe in God, oynon.
6192355001403709 I don't know where this girl came from, but their inquisition is up next. Our current situation is exactly the kind they're tailored to solve.\nHave you ever considered angels, 布拉克? How do you imagine them?
6192355001403714 但是审判官是人。
6192355001403715 Get a hold of yourself, oynon.
6192355001403716 ...你喝多了吗？
6192355001403713 An angel is a nightmare. Their purpose is to instill primal, oppressive horror.\nI think if angels existed, they'd resemble a divine pillar of light—from the heavens to the earth. Devoid of anything remotely human.

6192354999869802 “宫殿”？我从学校出来的。
6192354999869803 我就知道你会混成这样。
6192354999869804 也很高兴见到你。
6192354999869801 瞧瞧，是什么大人物光临寒舍！这不是我的好哥们艺术家阿泰米吗？或许这位阿泰米切割血管的？\n不...我不认识这个人。太柔弱了。他们肯定把他给宠坏，无论他是从哪个宫殿逃出来的。
6192354999869806 要是就好了。
6192354999869807 和你登上的不一样。
6192354999869805 登上了顶峰，是吗？
6192354999869809 啥？
6192354999869808 结束？当你的四肢没有弯曲的时候，结局就来了，哈哈，朋友，我还是很灵活的。你知道谁想结束吗？你。
6192354999869811 你现在是杂货商了？
6192354999869812 我可不是商品。
6192354999869813 这是正当防卫。
6192354999869810 一个消息灵通的人告诉我你现在可是个冷血罪犯了。我承认，老朋友，我很重视友情。你真幸运，我可以把你放在仓库里的任何地方，一只没有鹌鹑也没有夜莺会唱歌的地方。
6192354999869815 废话连篇。我知道你是做什么的。
6192354999869816 那是你的事情，与我无关。
6192354999869814 我卖的不是商品，是故事。这个小镇，这台伟大的机器，没有秘密作为润滑的话，齿轮可不会自己转动。
6192354999869818 你成了...大人物。
6192354999869819 我真他妈高兴。
6192354999869817 你真没幽默感。看到老朋友你难道不高兴吗？
6192354999869821 收集了不少。你现在是杂货商了？
6192354999869820 但说无妨，阿泰米，直呼我小偷好了。你知道，我们都会收获我们播种的东西。你真的恨我吗？…事实上，我为胖维拉德工作..在仓库区当探子。
6192354999869823 我的计划？...你为什么这么问？
6192354999869824 你知道杀害我父亲的凶手吗？
6192354999869822 当我没说。告诉我，朋友。你有什么计划？ 
6192354999869826 你要帮助我。你知道有关我父亲的死对吗？
6192354999869827 这地方唤起了回忆。
6192354999869825 那是自然？有什么值得高兴的？
6192354999869829 你尊敬他。
6192354999869830 你知道是谁杀死了他吗？
6192354999869828 那是当然。愿他安息。他是个体面人，是附近最好的医生。
6192354999869832 什么？你在说谎！
6192354999869833 我听说过了。
6192354999869831 ...小子，你家老头被杀了。今天夜里。你没听说吗？
6192354999869835 复仇。
6192354999869836 我会找出幕后主使。到时，走着瞧。
6192354999869834 有什么计划？复仇？或者做些技术含量更高的事？
6192354999869838 我承认，我怀疑是你的人干的。
6192354999869839 似乎小镇里肯定不止一个笨蛋。
6192354999869837 不。 我们自己打探的消息. 你不会认为是我们中一员干的吧？听着，我们不杀人。我们尊重传统。\n除了...我们中有个叫巴里的家伙，他一个月前离开了我们的小社团，自己创建了一个。现在，他们会杀人，但是他们绝对不会碰你家老头。他们不是白痴。
6192354999869841 ...我不相信你。
6192354999869842 行啊，如果你想做的话。
6192354999869843 不，我会自己解决这乱子。
6192354999869840 嘿, 阿泰米! 半个镇子的人都想为此要你的项上人头。这帮白痴。哈，很容易解决。只需要给我一丢丢时间。
6192354999869845 说完了吗？冷静点！
6192354999869846 管好你自己的脑袋，好吗？
6192354999869844 离萨普洛夫远一点。我是认真的，伙计——这家伙是个鹰，权势滔天，蛮不讲理。他会直接送你蹲牢房，然后几个月后才想起你...\n我知道你脑袋很硬！你会昂首挺胸走过去，想着，哦，正义必胜！狗屎。<i>离他远点。</i> 听清了吗？
6192354999869848 还没见他们。
6192354999869849 我去找了鲁宾。他不在家。
6192354999869850 我见了劳拉，她...变了。
6192354999869847 你见了老伙计？斯塔克·鲁宾, 劳拉?
6192354999869852 需要帮助？
6192354999869853 有的人记性很差啊。
6192354999869851 必须得说，我们的友谊渡过了艰难的时光——如果你还能称之为友谊的话。\n冷酷的劳拉不肯正眼看我，斯塔克更糟。他完全忽视我伸出的援手！
6192354999869855 人们把你的人当成是我？把他们中每一个都当成我？
6192354999869856 某种感觉告诉我，你的弟兄可不是去行善的。
6192354999869857 我来摆平。我毕竟<i>是个</i>外科医生。你的人还在这里吗？ 
6192354999869854 你最近经常在外面走动吗？简直是混乱不堪！无辜的灵魂被撕得支离破碎！每个人都丧心病狂地去猎捕罪魁祸首——一个大草原泥人，有人这么认为。但其他人呢？他们在寻找<i>你的 </i> 藏身处，朋友。\n因为这些的发生，我的弟兄不幸撞上一伙暴民，几乎没法活着出去。他们需要手术医生，非常需要。你的老人走了，而他的高徒斯塔克又不愿意接这工作，所以... 
6192354999869859 我需要工具。我身上没带。
6192355000258351 我会用你搁在这附近的手术刀。
6192354999869858 不在这。Shiner来过，说他们躲在一个地方等死。\n可怜的匹斯沃克，他肚子里卡着东西，已经半只脚迈进天堂了。你相信传说吗？他们都是变形怪，我保证。 sheddin' skin an' eatin' each other. 也许你没有看过，但是这个小镇的每一个人内心都住着邪恶的野兽。
6192354999869861 负罪感？我真不喜欢。 I
6192354999869862 我可以去看匹斯沃克一眼，他在哪？
6192354999869860 天晓得！完全搞不清他们现在的状况。只要你看一眼，你会发现匹斯沃克非常像你——一个固执的人，或许他不幸替你挡了几刀。你感觉到了吗？
6192354999869864 拉倒。我不能永远呆在这里。我在到那附近的时候会顺便去看病人。
6192354999869865 这还差不多。
6192354999869863 工具！ 给你全安排妥当了，朋友。来自仓库的祝福，非法货物的源泉——那里！看一眼那个板条箱，想拿什么那什么。\n 不过…也许你应该留下来。外面很危险。
6192354999869867 当纪念品？...你和以前一样古怪，本性难移。
6192354999869868 取决于我发现了什么。或许我留着有用。
6192354999869866 棒极了。你发现他肚子里有任何他不需要的东西，不要扔，回来带给我。或许有用、
6192354999869870 ...他对你来说一文不值？很好。
6192354999869871 不，我把匹斯沃克给拼好了。
6192354999869869 "让我们在山上休息，哦，让我们在河边休息…" 这是你的人民在日子艰难时唱的歌，不是吗？\n...匹斯沃克怎么样了？? 我估计他歇菜了。
6192354999869873 所以现在有什么计划？
6192354999869872 我的朋友！你学校没白读啊？ 让斯塔克见鬼去吧，他爱咋滴咋滴。他亲自上肯定不会比你棒。
6192354999869875 你的匹斯沃克是垃圾。他因为烧女人被捅了。 
6192355000164251 你知道你的人在当街谋杀女人吗？他们是你的人，坏格里夫！你的！!
6192354999869874 哈？他难道没有说声谢谢你，或者其他什么吗？
6192354999869877 我把他治好了。知道为什么吗？我想看看<i>你</i> 打算拿它怎么样。
6192354999869878 他死了，朋友。你告诉我切除他所有不需要的东西，所以我把它切除了。
6192354999869876 ...哦。镇民失去了理智，我告诉你，匹斯沃克自己的脑袋永远不适合当朋友。你对他做了什么？
6192354999869880 所以现在有什么计划？
6192354999869881 你明白我的意思了，格里戈里。你得小心点。再见。
6192354999869879 ...所以，你是个有趣的人，嗯？ 一个有趣的人，看来我得用眼睛盯着你。好，威武！
6192354999869883 这个。你的人喜欢利刃，不是吗？就是燃烧弹都没有这么残忍。
6192354999940164 肠子和大便。和通常一样。
6192354999869882 计划就是活下去。 呼吸，行窃，离开…\n你在匹斯沃克身体里找到了什么？只是好奇而已。
6192354999869885 子弹？
6192354999869886 孩子？
6192354999869887 我知道。某人给我提供了一笔很好的交易。
6192354999869884 好吧，那是你的人。我一直在想，我们这些乡巴佬是从哪来的。我明白了，我明白了……这就解释了上周谁闯入八号仓库。有线索了……我会记下这一点的。\n如果你找到更多的利刃，把他们带来给我。别把它们给孩子们，即使他们那子弹和你换。
6192354999869889 至尊装备?
6192354999869890 我不需要至尊装备。都是违禁品。
6192354999869888 那些孩子有些胆量。全副武装，参加战争当你不在的时候，他们把一块很好的草皮割下来了。\n 小凯恩不久就会来找我们麻烦了。你看，关键是，他们会把从我这里偷来的战利品给你作为交换。至尊装备。别犯傻，直接来找我。
6192354999869892 我会记住的。
6192354999869893 你太客气了。
6192354999869894 给我看看。
6192354999869891 我给自己弄了点小生意。你需要武器，或者任何非法的玩意，来找我。我会让你扫一眼货柜下面的东西。当然不是免费的。\n也没有折扣。我的人可不希望这样。我担保你在此交易畅行无阻，高兴吧。怎么样？
6192354999940166 你为什么问？只是好奇吗？
6192354999940165 遗憾。肠子是你的专长，不是我的。我手上的屎够多了。
6192354999869896 你对城里发生的事有什么了解吗？
6192354999869897 入股你认为我在这里格格不入，我可以走。
6192354999869895 啊，阿泰米大驾光临，学院的阿泰米！你需要什么？ 
6192354999869899 老板当然啊。告诉我现在权力的形式。
6192354999869900 谣言。
6192354999869898 哦，当然，我有关注，一切尽收眼底。死神双手紧握……我们的伟大领袖西蒙最后一次呼吸。\你还想知道什么？老板们有他们的计划，还是谣言？
6192354999869902 你是指胖维拉德?
6192354999869901 老样子。老鹰萨普洛夫掌权，但他只会叽叽喳喳。 \n凯恩家，和往常一样，绞尽脑汁想办法把小镇搬到下游去。呱呱叫。塔楼永远漂浮着！记下我的话，他们会把下一个区挂在云端。 \n至于主人嘛...他就是主人。 
6192354999869904 他是个卑鄙的人。
6192354999869903 当然如此。他坐的光鲜亮丽，丑陋的混蛋。把我打法到在仓库区的心脏。这里没有抱怨。古雅的居住地，“在我的脚下，整条铁路。你不打扰维拉德，“他也不会打扰你。
6192354999869906 是的，“报酬。”一个铜板可活不下去。
6192354999869907 这就是他为所有这些剥削行为辩护的方式…
6192354999869908 我猜。
6192354999869905 他首先是个有钱人，朋友。他操纵着整个机器。养活小镇。让我们可以挣钱养活自己。\n 不仅仅是我，这里的每个人。有多少人在罐头厂工作？在车站？仓库区就有四百个仓库。每个人都能得到实实在在的报酬。
6192354999869910 确实。
6192354999869911 他想从我这获得<i>某种东西</ i>，但我不知道是什么。
6192354999869909 胡乱猜测不会给你带来什么，朋友。不要管老肥了。他现在可不得了，任何不在工资单上的人都会被踩扁的，哈。
6192354999869913 发生了什么？
6192354999869912 你们大草原的人，所知道的只是牧牛，推犁。 \ n我们必须展望明天，兄弟。你认为凯恩对建筑有兴趣，为了什么呢？即便如此，谁来支付呢？一定要考虑你的胃。主人是个精明的人。虽然，他确实禁止进入白蚁......其中，我不是粉丝。
6192354999869915 如果我发现更多，我一定会告诉你。
6192354999869916 “一群狗”？瞅瞅镜子。你的舌头松的都要舔到地上了。
6192354999869917 “还是离死透只有一步之遥 “这不是你令人讨厌的名言吗？
6192354999869914 那里的家伙和胖维拉德有矛盾，几乎变得暴力冲突。很有道理！五千只动物必然会变成野兽。你的金族人就像一群狗，一只嚎叫着，其余的跟随着。但还是......
6192354999869919 西蒙怎么死的？
6192354999869920 你说的大地“拒绝接受”我爹是什么意思？
6192354999869921 这个学者是谁?
6192354999869922 告诉我更多关于这个古怪女孩的事。
6192354999869923 ...等等。那我的父亲呢?
6192354999869918 让我看看...西蒙之死，你已经知道了。大地拒绝接受你的父亲，你也知道了。 \ n 一个可怕的学者从首都而来。有些奇怪的女孩也和你同一天到了。一个好奇的人。对她是圣人我半信半疑。她把我的灵魂撕碎了，把它绞死干了...... 
6192354999869925 凯恩家仍在掌权，是吗？
6192354999869924 没人知道。我想是发烧了吧？\你注意到他和你爸爸在一起吗？戴上手套。总是在一起，密谋。可能会为我们这些愚蠢的生物创造一个未来。
6192354999869927 让我们换一个话题，镇子上其他呢？ 
6192354999869926 你甚至参加了葬礼，Cub？在那你有一些亲戚。 \ n随便了，我猜他们没有你也搞得定。烧了他，因为大地不接纳他。你的人民对此并不那么高兴。 
6192354999869929 凯恩家仍在掌权，是吗？
6192354999869928 立即抓住自己一块美味的馅饼。一个博学的人。一个名人。每个人都是为了争夺被他骂的权利撕破脸皮。凯恩家甚至邀请他成为他们的隔壁邻居。
6192354999869931 除了萨普洛夫家，还有谁掌握大权？
6192354999869930 关于她的一些事情。你了解我，我有一种敏锐的直觉。否则我就不会进展到这地步。我觉得她......甚至不完全是人类。虽然萨普洛夫家收养了她。 
6192354999869933 该死！我干嘛在这和你浪费时间？
6192354999869932 你现在不应该在墓园吗？他们一大早就一直在试图埋葬他，但不停“失败”。
6192354999869936 Nah. Just your smug mug.
6192355000167822 你有炸药吗？
6192354999869934 Checkin' out the wares?
6192355000167824 我想炸掉铁轨。
6192355000167825 他们说审判官即将到来。我们应该阻止他们进来，不是吗？
6192355000167826 Just nostalgic. Remember how we used to put bullets on train tracks?
6192355000167823 为什么？
6192355000167828 为什么不呢？我们一起干，就像以前老日子一样。
6192355000167829 …You're oddly enthusiastic about this. I was only joking.
6192355000167827 I see, I see…\nListen, artilleryman. You're a surgeon, not a bomber. Gotta be careful with those hands. Let's tackle this as a team.
6192355000167831 I'll figure it out.
6192355000167832 我理解各种各样准则。我会找到你的。
6192355000167833 Those aren't metaphors.
6192355000167830 午夜后进入大草原。沿着铁轨走……那些向外界敞开的长长的铁轨。是真正的铁轨，不是比喻。\n 你会发现我在等你。
6192355001221275 I'll figure it out.
6192355001221276 我理解各种各样准则。我会找到你的。
6192355001221277 Those aren't metaphors.
6192355001221274 几小时后进入大草原。沿着铁轨走……那些向外界敞开的长长的铁轨。是真正的铁轨，不是比喻。\n你会发现我在等你。
6192355000167835 What's with the fire? 等等，我认为你已经开始了，没我。
6192355000167834 你总算来了。我在这屁股都他妈要冻掉了。 
6192355000167838 I would've found you without it.
6192355000167841 Summon who? Bos Turokh?
6192355000167837 A fire… A signal fire, Cub. Used to summon.
6192355000167840 ...你耍我呢？
6192355000167848 好的。你带炸药了吗？
6192355000167839 What makes you think it's for you? It's not.
6192355000167843 What are you talking about? Is this some kind of prank, asshole?
6192355000167846 Well, I doubt you're trying to summon the 审判官.
6192355000167842 No, Cub. Bos Turokh is just a steppe folktale. Me, I'm simple. An ordinary man. And my goals, unlike yours, are ordinary too.
6192355000167845 你傻了吗，格里夫？你会是他们吊死的第一个人！ 
6192355000167847 你<i>确定</i>你没事吧？我看看你发烧了没。 
6192355000167844 Use your head, artilleryman. Of course we're not blowing anything up! This railroad is my bread and butter. My veins! Hell, my carotid arteries!\nBlowing things up… It doesn't matter. The 审判官 will come. They'll instill order. Fix you terrorists.
6192355000167850 So are we… not blowing anything up?
6192355000167849 Tell me, Cub: Have you completely lost it? What dynamite? What even makes you think I have some? Do you think I'm General Ashes? I'm a knife man. I never really told you I even <i>had</i> dynamite!
6192355000168752 My fault for trying to work together with you.
6192355000168753 All right. Forget it. Let's just watch the fire.
6192355000168751 …They're a smart bunch, or so I've heard. Explains the unique status. An' smart folk tend to stick together. Help each other climb the ladder, even…\nIt's you who should worry about gettin' hanged, idiot. Dynamite…
6192355000483594 Do you know what 斯塔克·鲁宾's been up to? He's kept me in the dark.
6192355000483595 What? Are you busy with something? I can't tell.
6192355000483593 What d'ya want, man?
6192355000483597 Have you seen him?
6192355000483608 Did he run into trouble?
6192355000483596 Then that's the way he wants it, isn't it? Why would I give you a lantern?
6192355000483599 I'm working too, then. Have you seen 鲁宾?
6192355000483598 Of course I am. I'm ruminatin'. What's that, if not work?
6192355000483601 Did he join your gang? That's… unexpected.
6192355000483611 You're neighbors now? So he hides out at the Warehouses?
6192355000483600 Ha. I'd pay good coin to never see him, but I can't help but bump into the man… Neighbors share labors, as the sayin' goes.
6192355000483603 And where would that hideout be?
6192355000483602 Screw your head back on, will you? You're shortin' out. We'd recruit a pig and all her piglets before we ever considered 鲁宾.\nHe just needed a hideout. And who'd help the poor sod but me? We're friends, after all.
6192355000483605 Yes. You have said enough. Thanks.
6192355000483606 If you're bumping into each other, he must be close.
6192355000483607 Fair enough. I'll find him on my own.
6192355000483604 Won't tell you. I promised to not sell him out, so I won't. Go look for it yourself. I've said enough.
6192355000483610 You mentioned you weren't seeing each other often, right?
6192355000483609 I'd like to know that, too. But he's a man with a code, like you. Doesn't trust me. Probably pains him to stoop to my level.\nDoesn't bother me. I'm not proud.
6192355000770378 What do you plan to do now?
6192355001430964 There's nothing to do here, anyway.
6192355000770377 Ne'er been up here. Can you imagine?
6192355001430952 I've been meaning to ask you. Why'd you go to her in the first place? She was an authority, and you…
6192355001430967 Same here. I'm depleted.
6192355001430968 Idiot.
6192355001430951 Nothin'. I don't want to do anythin' at all.
6192355001430954 Yeah.
6192355001430953 …A thief. An' not just any thief, but a kingfish. First at the gallows. That what you mean?
6192355001430956 How did it go?
6192355001430955 My thoughts exactly! That's why I went.\nYou're no player, Cub. If you know your hand will lose, get it over with so you can pull new cards. <i>Then</i> you can make a move. That was my plan, anyway… but that's not how it shook out.
6192355001430958 Well, she's not around anymore. Don't you want to go back?
6192355001430959 You worry me. You've always been weird, but you used to be lively, too.
6192355001430957 Didn't you see? I went to her ready to play cards, but she played checkers instead. Scratch that… She played <i>me,</i> like a damn flute. I couldn't have known.
6192355001430961 No. But I hope I will.
6192355001430962 So you've got a new grasp on time? Sounds good.
6192355001430960 You're an idiot, Cub. While I was there, I realized how that giant clock operates. I used to think that I understood it, but it's only now I truly do.\nI used to be the clocksmith, oilin' the Town's gears… and I'll stay a clocksmith, only a different kind. You see?
6192355001430966 Speaking of tracks… What do you plan to do with your life now?
6192355001430965 Why not just sit a while, soak up the mood? No need to make tracks.
6192355001430970 Well, I sort of am.
6192355001430971 Nah, I'm no less an idiot than you.
6192355001430969 Idiot, idiot, idiot… Do you know other words? Like you're such a genius.
6192355000831852 你在这做什么？
6192355000831874 你被捕了？
6192355000831851 …Yeah.
6192355000831854 这可不像你。
6192355000831857 Something's… off about you.
6192355000831853 Thinking.
6192355000831856 你说些啥呢？
6192355000831878 She was faster with me.
6192355000831855 We had a talk. I thought it'd be an interrogation. But no, we just… talked. For two hours.
6192355000831859 哇哦。你什么时候成哲学家了？ 
6192355000831862 她是个审判官, 格里夫。 To her, everyone's on a hook or string.
6192355000831887 If you want to think of yourself as a puppet, go ahead. That's not how I perceive myself.
6192355000831858 We're all toys, Cub. Just toys. Puppets.\nYou go about livin' an' breathin', all that, not a thought spared for your place in it all. But actually, you're pulled around by great strings. You think you're alive, but you ain't, pal. You ain't.\nWe have no right to call ourselves people.
6192355000831861 Are we, now?
6192355000831865 You aren't. You're filled with clockwork.
6192355000831860 Nothing to do with philosophy. We are filled with cotton.
6192355000831864 …She broke you to pieces.
6192355000831881 Keep thinking, pal. Perhaps you'll clear your head a bit.
6192355000831863 I don't want to live like that anymore. Perhaps I don't want to live at all. So, I'm thinking it over.
6192355000831867 People who <i>see the light</i> gain the will to live. I suspect it wasn't that.
6192355000831882 You mean, like a storekeeper?
6192355000831866 She knows what she's sayin'. She's a professional. She really is…\nI haven't figured it all out, not yet. But I've seen the light, Cub. I don't want to live like this.
6192355000831869 Perhaps you should do it yourself?
6192355000831883 Where would they go? Hunting in the night?
6192355001407552 Already done. Your warehouse is quiet now.
6192355000831868 By the way. If you could, could you drop by my warehouse? Just check on the guys. Tell 'em to lock the place up and scatter.\nTell 'em I said so. Tell 'em: "A long beak pecks millet." They'll listen.\nThey'll listen to you, anyway. They know you.
6192355000831871 All right… I'll pay them a visit. For the sake of an old friend.
6192355000831873 I won't do it. Deal with your people yourself.
6192355000831870 I can't do anything. Not from here. We've run all out of old 格里夫.
6192355000831876 I'll tell her you're not as scary as you try to seem.
6192355000831877 What does she want with you?
6192355000831875 Something like that, Cub. Not seized, so much, but bound.
6192355000831885 <i>You</i> tell them that.
6192355000831886 I don't like your tone.
6192355000831884 That's up to them. I'm not their leader anymore. Tell 'em that.
6192355001407554 I kind of did. You never wanted to mingle with that crowd.
6192355001407555 Nah. I just didn't like how they looked at me.
6192355001407553 Whoa... That was fast. Did you expect me to ask?
6192355001407557 Keep going, pal. I can tell something's brewing inside you.
6192355001407558 You'd better. I can't always be your errand boy.
6192355001407556 Well... 谢谢你, Cub, for cutting this string. One fewer now. Perhaps one day I'll even be able to move on my own...
6192355001638982 Is this... a shotgun? And here I thought you weren't a murderer after all.
6192355001638983 How did they let you in here with a gun?
6192355001638985 What do you mean, "no use"? I don't like the look on your mug. Keep it.
6192355001638981 You know what... have this gun. It's of no use to me anymore, and you seem to be fast on the draw.
6192355001638987 Sly. And even noble, in a way.
6192355001638988 ...But they've lost fear.
6192355001638989 格里夫, you're a moron! Carrying a shotgun "for show", really...
6192355001638986 It's a good gun, I suppose. Never checked. I only carried it for show. So they'd fear me...\nThat's how it works, y'know. They won't try anythin' as long as they're afraid. Won't get cocky, won't make you rein them in. Won't make you use the gun...
6192355001638991 What?
6192355001638990 It has no ammo. And, well...
6192355000833075 你不能逃避你自己，格里夫.
6192355000833088 去哪？
6192355000833091 那是懦夫行为。
6192355000833074 我们需要逃跑，伙计，逃跑。
6192355000833077 你和木偶，又来了！
6192355000833080 每一个木偶都有自己的角色。
6192355000833076 这就是你弄错的点！你自己，就是你需要逃离的对象！ Why would I want myself? 一个线上的木偶...
6192355000833079 他需要我做的事，<i>你</i>知道些什么？
6192355000833087 你说话什么时候这么...哲学了？
6192355000833078 逃跑才是唯一的出路。你还没明白吗Fate belies freedom.\n你是一个玩具。当你拥有命运的时候，你无法成为一个人，所以你必须打破它！这就是你家老头需要你做的事！
6192355000833082 What are you going on about?!
6192355000833081 他试图打破他的命运，还有小镇的命运。所以他死了。
6192355000833084 You're still out of it…
6192355000833085 我不会逃到任何地方。
6192355000833086 也许你是对的。
6192355000833083 你是榆木脑袋吗？我仿佛都跟你讲了一个小时了。\n当你是某人设计中的一个组成部分时，你根本不是活人。理解了吗？That's why the sand pest came upon us, mowin' us down, and we do nothin'. How could we? Just toys…
6192355000833090 哦，所以她对你而言不是毒妇了？
6192355000833089 告诉你,她帮我弄懂的。那个女人。这里是Here is the only place anything can be understood. We must stand by her.
6192355000833093 So?
6192355000833096 没有。
6192355000833092 No! It's not! 我不能够解释...沙疫杀掉的是<i>unfree,</i> 你理解了？
6192355000833095 什么游戏？什么规则？
6192355000833094 不要玩他们的游戏，遵守他们的规则。要有大局观！
6192355000833098 There's no design behind it all, 格里夫.
6192355000833099 It was "designed" by nature.
6192355000833097 The designers of the whole thing.
6192355000833101 Hm. I thought about this myself…
6192355000833102 格里夫。你精神错乱了。
6192355000833103 You've never been much of a thinker. I think you might've short-circuited this time…
6192355000833100 Who cares! It's still a matter of freedom. Either you turn human an' survive, or stay a doll an' die. It's that simple.\nThe plague separates people from dolls. Got it?
6192355000833105 Opened your eyes to what?
6192355000833106 What a lovely, empathetic woman.
6192355000833104 No, not a wench. A woman.\nShe's almost human, y'know. At least she gets what's goin' on here. An' she opened my eyes, too.
6192355001099152 Is this a bad moment?
6192355001100702 Oh, I'm sorry. <i>Clearly</i> you're terribly busy here.
6192355001100703 今天每个人怎么都吃错药了？你想也让我发狂吗？
6192355001099151 A guest is best when you see them less.
6192355001099155 Will you tell me?
6192355001099154 I've got enough on my plate.
6192355001099158 We're getting together this night. The four of us. The old place.
6192355001100706 Yeah? Well, to hell with you!
6192355001099157 No. Long tongues lead to short lives. If you have a point, get to it; if not, don't let the door hit you on the way out.
6192355001100705 What's wrong?
6192355001100704 Indeed, I <i>am</i> busy. Business doesn't make itself, oh, someone spins the gears.
6192355001100709 Well, we haven't seen each other in a while.
6192355001100710 Because it's time we stopped bickering.
6192355001100711 We can mend our old friendship. I'm sure we can.
6192355001100708 Huh? Why all of a sudden?
6192355001100713 Yes. Next to the Basket.
6192355001100714 Yes. The Apple Road, remember?
6192355001100712 The old place, as in by the Gumstone? At the railroad?
6192355001100716 No, we won't.
6192355001100717 Me and 斯塔克 are at each other's throats, too. He can barely stand me. Blames me for 父亲's death.
6192355001100715 …Go ahead. The three of you will have more fun without me.
6192355001100719 Precisely…
6192355001100720 Well, he's right, in a way. I can't stop thinking about it.
6192355001100718 Wow. What tree did he fall from to hurt his head so? Must have been that new tower.
6192355001100722 The ones cutting people?
6192355001100723 It's not just your plate. It's everyone's, now.
6192355001100721 I don't know, Cub… I've got a full plate here. Those men, the night hunters, they're too fond of playin' with knives. Way too fond… Where'd they all even come from?
6192355001100725 Just come to our old place. Did you hear me? Please come. No one will blame you.
6192355001100726 So, take this chance to explain it to 斯塔克 and 劳拉… and me.
6192355001100727 We'll figure it out together. I won't abandon you.
6192355001100724 Not my fault. But… somehow, it is. Never took blood, but I dressed for a red harvest. How it bloomed…\nForget it. I'll deal with it myself.
6192355001099160 They sense trouble.
6192355001100728 There weren't so many crows in town before, were there?
6192355001100729 Listen. Do you want to talk about the merry knife men? The night hunters.
6192355001099159 A murder of crows, huh?
6192355001100731 What will you do with the cutthroats?
6192355001100730 Huh?
6192355001100733 I think you need to pick a side.
6192355001100747 It's up to you, pal. But you won't last long, not this way.
6192355001100732 What can I even do? Pretend I'm still their leader to their face, then disown 'em around polite society? Already on it. What else is there?
6192355001100735 Any dark prophecies to share? You're the criminal mastermind here, after all.
6192355001100736 So the outbreak makes you happy, huh?
6192355001100734 It's too late for me, Cub. I've only got one road ahead of me now.\nPerhaps the outbreak is for the best… Plagues are like fires, people forget old scores. And all hell will break loose here soon.
6192355001100738 Not all of them, 格里夫. Not all.
6192355001100748 We'll see.
6192355001100737 No need to prophesize. People fear hunger. Even honest workers will turn their hatchets and hammers to crime. Burglin' houses, lootin' corpses, guttin' each other.\nThey will. <i>Oh, they will.</i>
6192355001100740 Where did they all go to, I wonder? It's all crows now…
6192355001103251 …Scared, aren't you, brother?
6192355001100739 Nope. It was all sparrows before. And larks. And a fair share of starlings.
6192355001100743 Bite your tongue.
6192355001100744 So what will you say to your thugs, then?
6192355001100741 Heed my wisdom: We're all in for it. It only took them as little as yesterday to start cuttin' folks… Means they'll soon go completely an' absolutely off their rocker.\nPeople get used to death all too quick.
6192355001100746 What are you planning to do?
6192355001100745 They're no longer mine, Cub. Mine are all at my side. Although… hell, why pretend? Not all of them. Not all of them are mine anymore.\n…And then there were none.
6192355001100750 Big words…
6192355001103252 You're right.
6192355001100749 The turf's so dry, you don't even need a match—a glare would start a fire.\nAnd when the Kin bares its teeth, that's when we'll all dance! They're slow on the start, but oh so fast on the draw! The Master likes them mute and obedient, but apathy makes them that way, not stupidity. They're only obedient till the time comes.\nAnd here it comes.
6192355001103254 Who knows…
6192355001103255 No, I doubt it.
6192355001103256 I think he might have suspected. Perhaps that's why he locked the Termitary, to protect the workers.
6192355001103253 And the people who lose their jobs? They won't be too fond of staying home. They'll find new hobbies, like looking for food, or venting their anger.\n…And Fat 维拉德 shut his facilities down the day before yesterday, didn't he? Crafty… Didn't whisper so much as a single word to me. Do you think he knew?
6192355001103259 He made a hard choice. Perhaps if he had more time, he could've found a better solution…
6192355001103260 Oh, stop whining. I promise you'll be all right.
6192355001103257 If it's the same sand pest we saw five years ago, we're all finished. There was no salvation from it. Every single person in the Crude Sprawl died. \nYour 父亲 was fast enough to lock the doors back then, so it died there. Only reason we're still alive. Now we can't even lock the gate… an' there's no one to lock it, either.
6192355001103262 Calm down.
6192355001103261 Thanks for sharing your opinion. Now shove it up your ass.
6192355001412551 Where's 阿格莱雅? I mean, the 审判官? Like, the commissar?
6192355001288954 …Yet they, too, are controlled by someone. Insane to think what kind of teeth you need for <i>that.</i>
6192355001412553 What orders?
6192355001412570 She went on her own?
6192355001412552 She sent three people after the general to deliver orders of some kind. Then she left herself, too—after them, I guess. To our blighted headquarters, where else?
6192355001412555 Shit, this is dangerous! Headquarters won't be happy to see her.
6192355001449163 I see… Do you have anything here to eat?
6192355001412554 Just orders, somethin' about the bombardment. It's not like she reports to me. I just keep my eyes on the ball…\nIt's about the Polyhedron, I think. It bothers her. Sometimes it even seems like that's why she came to the Town at all… You know how it is with them. There's always a mask behind a mask.
6192355001412560 Huh?
6192355001412571 Now isn't the time to get sentimental.
6192355001412559 …Sit with me, brother.
6192355001412562 No one drags me. I make my own choices.
6192355001412563 No, 格里夫. I need to go.
6192355001412561 I mean it. Come on, sit. They're draggin' you down your path, so don't go. Imagine how shocked they'll be when you don't listen!
6192355001412565 You're a puppet.
6192355001412566 That's it. I've had enough of your puppet talk.
6192355001412564 Don't go. Let them break their fingers… Or are you just a puppet?
6192355001449155 Where did she go, 格里夫? Snap out of it for a second.
6192355001449156 And to you, she's what? A three-headed dragon?
6192355001449154 Relax. I can see she's just an ordinary human to you.
6192355001449158 Whatever… Sooner or later, she'll leave, and you'll return to normal. Hopefully you won't become a monk. Where is she?
6192355001449157 Perhaps she is.
6192355001449160 What orders did she send?
6192355001449159 Nah, she just sent them a portrait of herself. Of course she went on her own! Are you all right in the head, Cub?
6192355001449162 Perhaps I do care.
6192355001449167 I guess.
6192355001449161 Why do you care? If they actually shot the witch, we should bow down an' kiss their feet. But they didn't, and won't. She's not so simple.
6192355001449165 You're the idiot.
6192355001449166 Great. Well, see you.
6192355001449164 An idiot, are you? I'm feastin' on my former sins. I'm far from starvation.
6192355001397658 I locked up the warehouse, 格里夫. And bashed a number of heads in.
6192355001397657 Will you stop slumpin'? You look like a question mark, not a person.
6192355001397660 Never heard that one.
6192355001405666 How are you…?
6192355001397659 There was this story of a besieged town. People were starvin' there. One of them says, "That's it, I'm seein' angels."\nAn' the other replies, "Can we eat them?"
6192355001405653 That's fine, I'm used to it.
6192355001405654 …You're welcome.
6192355001405652 So what, you want a treat an' a pat on the head? Hope you didn't strain a muscle bashin' theirs.
6192355001405656 Is this... a shotgun? And here I thought you weren't a murderer after all.
6192355001638968 How did they let you in here with a gun?
6192355001405661 There won't be a next time.
6192355001638955 No. Keep it.
6192355001405655 Did… did my salvation come at the cost of you gettin' your hands bloody? Dirty business…\nYou know what… here. Have this gun. Will at least help keep things cleaner next time… maybe.
6192355001405658 You've never been a villain. A crook, sure. But not a villain.
6192355001405663 And here I thought you pawned your conscience years ago.
6192355001405657 Guess I'm not a villain anymore. My conscience is burnin' like a witch…
6192355001405668 格里夫, I… the Warehouse gang has a new leader now.
6192355001405667 ...
6192355001405670 Yes.
6192355001405671 Not anymore.
6192355001507904 They've never been yours, blockhead.
6192355001405669 One of my lot?
6192355001405673 Wake up! I didn't lock up your warehouse.
6192355001405672 That's all right. My lot can be trusted. And if they're not mine, who cares.
6192355001405675 You abandoned them yourself. Stop whining.
6192355001405676 Honestly, as long as I can buy ammo there, I don't care that much who sells it...
6192355001405674 Well, in that case, buy yourself a ticket in the front row! Gonna be a real show, those vultures fightin' over meat, or shivs, or…
6192355001405678 The guy I extracted a shiv from?
6192355001405681 The guy whose guts I cut out?
6192355001407551 I don't.
6192355001405677 You always gotta have it your way… There's some undeniable freedom inside you.\nRemember my 匹斯沃克?
6192355001405683 That's the only way I know, 格里夫...
6192355001515151 You know? When you get tired of watching the pendulum, do drop by.
6192355001405682 That's the one. I asked a favor of you, an' you had it your way… No lies, sort of. You get it? That's it: inner freedom. Miles above the rest of us.
6192355001405685 I think so…
6192355001405688 No.
6192355001405684 Here's what I'm thinkin', Cub. God gave you golden hands, so you became a healer. If you had bear paws, you'd be a gravedigger.\nWhy did your old man send you away? 'Cause you're his successor. And naturally talented, to boot. You catch my drift?
6192355001405691 Who?
6192355001405692 I don't know...
6192355001405690 Point bein', you never had a choice. Your path was tailored for you, with a pretty bow on top.\nBut who's the tailor, Cub?
6192355001405694 What do you think of <i>your</i> fate?
6192355001515152 Ugh! Here we go again.
6192355001405693 I don't know either! Fate?
6192355001405696 So what in the world are you unhappy about?
6192355001405695 I used to be a thief, yet they made me a storekeeper. And what a perfect fit I made!\nI got my Warehouse kingdom, and with it, the insides of the Town's great machine. I kept 维拉德's riches while havin' all I could dream of. Can't imagine a sweeter life.
6192355001405698 I guess so.
6192355001405699 If the fit was so perfect, what are you doing here? Go back to the Warehouses.
6192355001405697 Was I tailored for that life, then? The fit <i>was</i> perfect.
6192355001405701 So what would you have us do? Run away, hoping the strings tear?
6192355001515153 I'm done. I'm done, you hear me? Get a hold of yourself!
6192355001405700 I don't want it anymore. I don't want that fate. I want a <i>choice.</i>\nOnly, I'm danglin' from a string, Cub. Just like you. We're bound.
6192355001405703 To hell with this <i>freedom,</i> then.
6192355001405704 You really ought to stop this.
6192355001405702 Well, I know I didn't run far. The moment the grip loosened, I stopped—and… well. Here I am, sittin', nice an' quiet…
6192355001638957 Sly. And even noble, in a way.
6192355001638958 ...But they've lost fear.
6192355001638959 格里夫, you're a moron! Carrying a shotgun "for show", really...
6192355001638956 It's a good gun, I suppose. Never checked. I only carried it for show. So they'd fear me...\nThat's how it works, y'know. They won't try anythin' as long as they're afraid. Won't get cocky, won't make you rein them in. Won't make you use the gun...
6192355001638970 What?
6192355001638969 没有子弹，好吧...
6192354999936852 坏格里夫
6192355001258452 坏格里夫
6192354999869938 牛老大·维拉德. 我很荣幸。
6192354999869939 你想从我这得到什么？
6192354999869940 “他曾经”是什么意思？他还在城里，对吧
6192354999869937 熟悉的老面孔……你知道，我记得你尊敬的父亲曾经的样子——当他年轻的时候。毕竟，那是十五年前。\他是一个非常正派的人…他有一个真正的脊梁。6192354999869942 It was.
6192354999869943 还好。并不出乎我意料。
6192354999869941 欢迎回家，我亲爱的孩子…欢迎回家。不过，接待会相当……冷淡？不是吗？
6192354999869945 那你为什么召见我？
6192354999869946 我顺道过来，只是为了过去的时光。我没有更好的事可做。
6192354999869944 来吧，现在……我什么都不想要。你是有需求的人，我想我会很快了解到你的需求的。
6192354999869948 那会很有用。你真的能吗？
6192354999869949 我不需要帮助。我已经完全处理了这团乱子——好吧，部分的。
6192354999869950 他们是暴徒，确实。但它们不是猪。
6192354999869947 我收到报告说你是个恶棍，我的孩子…一个杀气腾腾的恶棍。我的人因为不能把你关进牢里而感到非常不安。他们是个丑陋的暴徒，不是吗？这么小心谨慎。动物……野兽……野猪。至少你溜走了。\n 我应该…支持你？
6192354999869952 你在说些什么？
6192354999869953 你知道是谁杀了他吗？
6192354999869951 现在更像了！一个独立的小伙子…就像你父亲一样。他也鄙视惠顾。总是独来独往…甚至不接受我的建议。不会向任何人鞠躬的。\n 惭愧。一个软脊梁骨有时可以是有用的…它可以改善每个人的处境。
6192354999869955 多年来，你对待这个镇上的平民如同对待牛。你希望我站在你这边吗？
6192354999869956 他们不是。
6192354999869957 我们每个人心中都藏着一只野兽。你也不例外，牛老大。
6192354999869954 你不认为他们是野兽吗？嘿，嘿！
6192354999869959 你不欠我什么, 牛老大.
6192354999869960 所有人真的服从你吗？
6192354999869961 我没有忘，牛老大, 相信我。而且我也不是唯一记得的人。 
6192354999869958 我的力量是巨大的，孩子。你忘了吗？你在这里看到的一切都是我的！整个公牛企业……屠宰场、工厂、仓库、火车站……这个镇的血管是我的缰绳。它的肉和骨头，我的王座！\n 我是主人……我希望得到服从。
6192354999869963 所以你为什么召见我？
6192354999869964 那么，你在进行调查吗？
6192354999869962 不是你，我知道那么多。但我们会...很快发现的。很快。
6192354999869966 谋杀？！谁杀了他？
6192354999869965 ……被谋杀了。今晚。我表示哀悼…你不知道？
6192354999869968 我为什么要这么做？
6192354999869969 谢谢，我会考虑的。
6192354999869970 不，我不想被关在笼子里。
6192354999869967 至少…接受我的建议。我一直很想帮助伊西多的儿子。\n 先在这儿呆一会儿……别出去。我的房子很大，有足够的空间。如果你需要什么，就叫仆人来。
6192354999869972 好吧。谢谢信任我。
6192354999869973 找到凶手是我现在的责任。
6192354999869971 仿佛他们有选择一样！我已经拉了几根绳子。一两句关于你的话，我的孩子……还有你尊敬的父亲。我们说话的时候一张大网正在行动。\n 仆人把话传给上级……上级和下级交谈……下级，安抚群众。而暴徒……暴徒最终会抓住你父亲的凶手。
6192354999869975 谢谢你, 牛老大。只有死亡才能让我停下休息。
6192354999869976 我的未来我会自己负责。
6192354999869974 为了你的未来，我的孩子。有什么急事？休息一下……你受了这么多苦。镇上的其他人……也会因你而得到休息。
6192354999869978 我的父亲在哪?我需要...我需要见他的遗体。
6192354999869979 链条？你觉得你能把我锁起来吗？
6192354999869977 别到处乱跑了，孩子……你没必要离开。我不会把你拴起来，但相信我……在外面，你只会把事情搞得一团糟。
6192354999869981 我现在很紧急。我需要向我父亲表示最后的敬意。
6192354999869982 那我该怎么办？袖手旁观？
6192354999869980 我可以，我的孩子…很容易。
6192354999869984 这些天他们把我的人民埋在哪里？在新的墓园？
6192354999869985 这是真的。
6192354999869983 好吧……他可能已经入土了。你的人民永远不会在死亡仪式上逗留。他们立即埋葬死者…就像种子一样，是吗？如果你花太长时间，种子就不会发芽。
6192354999869987 此时，我的父亲已经死了！他的遗体在哪？
6192354999869986 没错，我的孩子……它会让你活着。
6192354999869989 我需要走了。再见， 牛老大.
6192354999869990 是的。
6192354999869991 父亲不认为过去的就已经过去了。我也是。
6192354999869988 再也没有“你的人民”了。你的，我们的…我们都是普通人。过去的都过去了，所以我们都埋在一起了。不过，你的仪式还是不同的……你的同类必须在早上埋葬，是吗
6192354999869993 我需要先找到凶手。
6192354999869994 为什么这么问？
6192354999869992 听着…你打算为你父亲报仇吗？
6192354999869996 正确的人就是杀他的人。这并不难。
6192354999869997 这是我自己的事，牛老大。不是你的。
6192355000850065 谢谢你的热情款待，牛老大。但是我要出发了。
6192354999869995 凯恩急于谴责某人。萨普洛夫则打算处决某人。我呢…我会确保找到合适的人。是的…正确的那个。
6192354999869999 你究竟什么意思？
6192354999869998 那不是你的事。
6192355000717272 酒吧？也许。比待在这里强。
6192355000717273 我不喝酒，现在不是时候。
6192355000717275 腿带我到哪我就到哪。
6192355000717271 你现在可以去酒吧……为了纪念你父亲喝两口？在破碎之心的蓷薾毒药很流行……斯塔马丁经营得很好……在我允许下……
6192354999870001 我需要进屠宰场。
6192354999870002 我不是一头被畜养的小牛。
6192354999870000 你的灵魂如此不安，布拉克大师。或者你是来执行我的计划了？
6192354999870004 个人理由。
6192354999870005 里面有个女孩我想见一面。
6192355000276332 有人想搬进去。
6192354999870003 为什么...容我询问？
6192354999870007 里面发生了什么事？
6192354999870008 好吧，随意。
6192354999870006 你没必要去蚁巢，我的孩子…根本没必要。这是我的地盘…我知道我在说什么。
6192354999870010 是的
6192354999870011 不，我说的是一个完全不同的女孩。
6192354999870009 你，不会恰好……指的是指工头泰吉的女儿？
6192354999870013 然而，我想得到进入的许可。
6192354999870014 谢谢，牛老大。 让人安心多了。
6192354999870015 不过，我应该担心吗？里面发生了什么事？
6192354999870012 不足为奇。泰吉的女儿在那里很受欢迎……甚至被崇拜。迎合，照顾…没有你。她会没事的。不用担心。
6192354999870017 他们不会无缘无故造反的。
6192354999870018 也许你该给他们发工资了？
6192354999870016 暴民造反，我的孩子…暴民造反。工人……很容易被煽动。迅速地抛弃他们的人性，变成狂暴的野兽……因为他们就是这样。\n 不过，没关系……他们会变回去的的。但只要他们吵闹，我就把他们锁紧。它会爆发…这不是第一次。
6192354999870020 你的牙齿很锋利，我知道。
6192354999870021 我不为你工作，牛老大.
6192354999870019 别告诉我怎么经营我的生意，我的孩子。我…喜欢你，至少现在。别给我看你的牙齿，我也不用给你看我的。
6192355000276329 它仍然是个监狱。
6192355000276330 好吧，让我们结束这个话题。
6192355000276331 拜托，别喊了。你会中风的。
6192355000276328 你根本不知道你在说什么，布拉克。他们告诉过你什么关于蚁巢？是监狱吗？\n 那座木城被烧毁后，我建造了那座巨大的碉堡。他们拥挤在一起？嗯，他们以前不是！它很紧，因为…它们在<i>繁殖！</i>当人们的生活条件很差时，他们会繁殖吗？不...他们会死光！如果他们这样做，他们会有更多的空间，但他们没有！我说得清楚吗？
6192355000276334 嗯，我个人也想进去。
6192355000276336 这种体积的建筑物里容纳五千人？简直是个酷刑室！
6192355000276333 不好，不好……它已经塞满了。五千个灵魂……不开玩笑，我的孩子。
6192355000012752 这里发生了什么？
6192355000012753 非常清楚。一个家庭医生。听话的医生，对吗？
6192355000012754 什么流行病？
6192355000012751 流行病，布达克……瘟疫。如果是五年前夺走我的三百名工人性命的沙疫，那么就麻烦了……麻烦大了，我的孩子。你父亲当时救了我们。\n 但是现在……现在我需要你……在我身边。我说清楚了吗？
6192355000012756 我当然知道。所以很不幸我不得不拒绝，牛老爷。我有自己的事要处理。
6192355000012757 我不是你的孩子，牛老大.
6192355000012758 我会帮助你的家族，牛老大—如果你能够帮我。
6192355000012755 你知道吗，布拉克……在过去，海盗们常常捕杀载有医生的船只……因为他们比黄金更值钱。想象一下！\n 我自己也有点像个老海盗……呵呵。小心点，孩子。你当然很感激你的…价值…现在。
6192355000012760 现在谁话事？
6192355000012767 这是医学会议吗？为什么不邀请我？
6192355000012759 你还不明白……你是个顽固的愣头小子。但你会明白的。当三层厚的尸体躺在伊西多上面时……也许我们会再谈一次。
6192355000012762 我是个医生。我需要了解全局。
6192355000012761 这与你无关，布拉克。所有能完成的重要事情…我已经做完了。\n 会有一个基金。会有一个总部……阴谋……不眠不休的夜晚。这里的每个人都认为他们对战胜疫情至关重要……但他们很害怕。犯错。他们能告诉你什么？
6192355000012765 你怎么知道这是同一样东西？
6192355000012766 也许它会过去的。
6192355000012764 沙疫。我们当时称之为沙虫。致命的……所有生病的人都死了。没有幸存者。而且传染性很强布拉克…非常强。
6192355000012769 没关系，我会处理的。一个小时的谈话足矣。让我进去。
6192355000012770 这是你的错。你应该从一开始就邀请我。
6192355000012771 好吧。我不热衷于闲聊。我需要知道什么？
6192355000012768 你手头有空吗？然后去他们每一个谈谈……和一、二、三个人……用细节填满你的脑袋。时间…时间不多了。你的时间！\n 七个毫无意义的对话……你不需要它们。我可以告诉你你需要知道的一切。
6192355000012773 Me excluded? 为什么？
6192355000012776 Got it.
6192355000012777 Nice. I happen to be out of cash.
6192355000012772 We have four doctors. Well… three, you excluded. They'll work on the epidemic. The headquarters will be here. All your actions… I mean, their actions… will be accounted for and rewarded by the Anti-Epidemic Fund. \nI like incentivizing… entrepreneurship. If you work well, you are paid well. So rest assured, they won't sit on their hands.
6192355000012775 Fair enough. You can count on me, 牛老大.
6192355000012778 Let me make myself clear: In this war, I'm on the frontlines. Got it?
6192355000012779 But I have mine.
6192355000012774 I have my own plans for you.
6192355000545514 I didn't expect you'd actually come.
6192355001496555 No. Nothing to be happy about…
6192355001496556 I guess I am.
6192355000545513 Happy now?
6192355000545516 So you risked everything for your son?
6192355000545517 I didn't expect this from you, 牛老大. I took you for a completely heartless creature.
6192355000545515 There wasn't enough… I sent people to seize him and drag him to my place, but he was long gone…\nSo I came here to rescue the boy. But he wasn't here, either…
6192355000545519 I'll try. I'll lead the Kin away from here. That's what it was all about, anyway.
6192355000545520 That's not how it works. You must be held accountable for your crimes.
6192355000545518 Help me get out of here, will you?
6192355000547952 Do you know what's going on in the Termitary, 牛老大?
6192355000547980 Your son is going to the Termitary.
6192355000547951 That's all right… That's all right… We'll take it all back. Our feet are firmly planted. Even if it all comes crumbling down, even if every single one of them dies, we will rebuild it.
6192355000547970 Better ask me how many survivors. Not a lot.
6192355001490611 All of them, as far as you are concerned.
6192355000547969 The victims…
6192355000547972 Go and count yourself. Those are your people, 牛老大.
6192355001492430 Your son is on his way there. He'll do the counting.
6192355000547971 To make the Factory work again… at a third of its power, at least… to cover the most urgent deliveries… Are there a thousand left, at least?
6192355000547974 They're waiting for you, 牛老大.
6192355000547996 Your son is going there in your stead. I just wanted to let you know.
6192355000547973 I have special people on payroll who do just that… but they have no way of getting inside. Or… maybe you can guide them in? Since you've apparently found a hole.
6192355000547976 Go to them, 牛老大. Now. They want to look you in the eye.
6192355000547975 And they're seeking my blood? I'll go… but not right now. Later. When things calm down.\nGo back to your business, my boy. Thanks for the news, but it's nothing new. So go.
6192355000547982 To confess. He was the one who locked up the Termitary. You didn't even know, did you?
6192355000547981 What for?
6192355000547984 So you did?
6192355000547983 The whelp… The idiotic whelp… I didn't know? <i>I</i> didn't know?!
6192355000547986 So what's your plan?
6192355001492431 So you do care about your son, after all?
6192355000547985 That whelp is too cocky, thinking he's responsible for anything… Too eager to take my place…\nNo, it's a bit too early for him to get in my way. <i>I</i> am the Master… This is <i>my</i> business. <i>I</i> will bear the consequences.
6192355000547988 Don't you think you should go there instead?
6192355000547987 …I'm sending people to seize that whelp and get him over here. Let him wallow in his conscience here… Guilty, pah! Responsible, my ass!
6192355000547993 
6192355000548024 
6192355000547992 
6192355000547995 Scared?
6192355000548008 They just want to look you in the eye.
6192355000547994 Are you out of your mind, my boy? I'm not going anywhere now. And I would advise you follow my example.
6192355000547998 I warned you, 牛老大.
6192355000548001 Better you go to them now… than they come to you later. Let them look you in the eye. That's how they say it.
6192355000547997 Who do you take me for? You dare bully me? You dare push <i>me?</i> I'll rip all your throats out! And I won't even break a sweat! You pathetic weeds, you mindless calves…
6192355000548010 I warned you. If things turn bad, it'll be your fault.
6192355000548009 You are a gullible kid, Master 布拉克… You have the heart of a dove. If you value your life so little, go to them yourself… Your legs are still young. But spare me your ridiculous ideas. I am a sane man.
6192355000548852 They've changed. Recent events have transformed them. Sand pest does that to people.
6192355000548003 So do I. I saw them. Else I wouldn't be here.
6192355000548004 If you go to them now, you'll do it as a master. But if you linger, your role will change.
6192355000548851 Oh, I will… I've no plan to tremble at the sight of them… <i>They</i> will cower with their tails between their legs. I am the power. I am the authority. And they know it.
6192355001490610 How many what?
6192355001490609 I can guess, my boy… I can guess… If everything there was all right, you wouldn't barge in here with your eyes so wide…\nHow many…?
6192355001490613 He's going to them. To us. What don't you understand?
6192355001490612 What?
6192355001492433 Wait any longer, and you won't have a son at all. Because he's going to them.
6192355001492432 What…?\nDon't you dare try to pry into my soul! This is my son. This is my sin. We'll figure things out on our own, he and I… No assistance required. Get lost.
6192355001576753 Your son is going to the Termitary.
6192355001576751 Back again, 布拉克? Hmph… like a shuttle in a weaver's loom…
6192355000547956 Your son's in danger. He intends to go to the Termitary. To calm your people down.
6192355000548018 Yeah. My overshoes.
6192355000547955 Have you… forgotten something?
6192355000548007  
6192355000548011  
6192355000548006 Idiot! Oh, what an idiot! He still takes them for people. It's all fun and games to him… but they're not people, they're bloodthirsty beasts. They'll tear his head off.
6192355000548013 Everything turned out fine.
6192355001492434  
6192355000548012 I'll send my people to seize that dimwit and bring him here. He can remain… in my custody for a while. It's for the best.\nRemember how you refused my protection… how that turned out?
6192355000548015 In that ruined house with the well, as always.
6192355000548016 Who knows…? He doesn't report to me.
6192355000548017 Find him on your own. You have enough people.
6192355000548014 Where is he now? Do you know?
6192355000548020 What do you mean?
6192355000548021 What do books have to do with it? Those are your people. You need to go. Not him.
6192355000548019 You're a funny man, 布拉克… Read too many romantic novels, do you? Keep to your anatomy books…
6192355001492436  
6192355001492435  
6192355000547958 I'll drag you out of this, too.
6192355000547959 I will.
6192355000547957 Listen… Take care of my daughter. She's the last of our family now.
6192355000547961 I will.
6192355000547962 It's impossible. She's beyond salvation now.
6192355000547960 You won't. We're done for. Just save my daughter! Give me your word you'll save her.
6192355000547965 What can I do for you?
6192355000547964 No. Just to watch.
6192355000547963 Our family's over, 布拉克. It's time… to pay. My daughter is no more… Did you come to gloat?
6192355000547967 I do.
6192355000547968 God is merciful.
6192355001496557 I'll lead them away from here. Perhaps you'll still have a chance.
6192355000547966 Nothing. Forgive me if I ever wronged you.
6192355000770380 The same as before?
6192355001439765 Huh. I expected to see you broken, 牛老大.
6192355000770379 No, my boy… Life's not over yet. Not over. It only looks broken… but we will start anew. We will rebuild it…
6192355001439764 Where will you start?
6192355001439770 The Bull Enterprise is dead.
6192355001439763 Before? No… no. The past is in the past… Buried.\nYet she lives… She's buried, but hasn't passed away. I'll follow her legacy. Coming here every day… Listening to her advice…
6192355001439767 Where will you start?
6192355001439771 Good luck, 牛老大 维拉德.
6192355001439766 Me? Broken? No one has ever seen that… and no one ever will. Yes, no better time for hard work… than now. Time to get dirty again… No one's better suited for that… than me. No one.
6192355001439769 Fair enough.
6192355001439775 Expecting to live long, I see… 牛老大.
6192355001439768 I'll start with myself, my boy… with myself. My seventh decade is just around the corner… Now is the time.
6192355001439773 We'll see.
6192355001439774 I hope it changes.
6192355001439772 It is sick, my boy… merely sick. It will get better. You are a healer of humans, but I… I'm used to this patient. As one doctor to another… trust me. It'll live.
6192355000850069 Why are the 凯恩s even involved?
6192355000850070 You knew I was back. Wasn't your word enough?
6192355001097758 Did you see what's happening on your porch?
6192355000850068 Good thing you've come to visit, Master 布拉克… Right on time… Early bird gets the worm, indeed. The 凯恩s plan to take away your house. \n伊西多's dead, God rest his soul, and his heir is on the run… The decision will be made today.
6192355000850072 I don't get it. Please explain.
6192355000850075 I know this.
6192355000850071 As you should know, the Town is ruled by three families…\nI hold the economy. The屠宰场, the Factory, the Station, the Warehouses… Known collectively as the Bull Enterprise. A silly name, but it stuck… 萨普洛夫 upholds the peace, he handles the populace. And the 凯恩s… the 凯恩s build. Houses, other structures, general planning… All on them.
6192355000850074 What do they want to forge people into?
6192355000850076 That's harsh.
6192355000850077 Does it work?
6192355000850073 You don't know our history? That's a shame…\nThe 凯恩s built our town on their fancy ideas… Composed an entire philosophy of town planning, heh heh. Experimenting on human souls, no less.\nThey see the Town as a machine. A tool. A special place, like a crucible for remaking the mind and spirit of man.
6192355000850079 Why do they want my 父亲's house?
6192355000850090 What do you propose we do?
6192355000850078 They want to forge an overman, one to rival God. Not even to forge one, but to let him grow up on his own. Idealistic airheads… That's who they are.\nMe, I pull the chain the other direction. Humans are beasts. The simpler, the more useful, heh heh… At least my little theory proves itself right with plentiful coin.
6192355000850081 What kind of interest?
6192355000850082 Get to the point.
6192355000850080 Depends on how you look, Master 布拉克… Oh, it depends. It's not for me to judge. I am a down-to-earth man, yes… I work with meat, not castles in the sky.\nBut at times, they build compelling things. They have a special interest in the spaces inside buildings.
6192355000850084 So what do I do?
6192355000850091 Let them have it.
6192355000850083 The 凯恩s see all houses, including yours, as cogs in a machine. They might decide to demolish it, or do something else entirely. \nThe late 西蒙 凯恩 was close to your 父亲. One could say they were friends. Opposites truly do attract… Yes, they do.
6192355000850086 谢谢你, 牛老大.
6192355000850087 I don't want that house. Too many heavy feelings.
6192355000850085 Go see the Judge, that is, 乔尔基 凯恩. With his brother 西蒙 dead, he is in charge. Go to him and assert your claim… \nHurry. Georgiy wakes at dawn and never takes back decisions… That's just how he is.
6192355000850089 Alright, I'll look into it.
6192355000850092 The 凯恩s live in the Crucible, right?
6192355000850088 If you don't want the house for yourself, I'll be happy to take it off you. I'll pay you good money for it… Never let a good thing go to waste, I always say. There's no changing the 凯恩s' minds with money—they have enough. You, however, might succeed.\nGo see the Judge, and soon. It might be too late in an hour or two.
6192355001097760 Why did you shut down the Factory?
6192355001097761 That's where you're wrong. It does concern me. Being a doctor in a town where two thirds of the people are unemployed is…
6192355001097759 I don't have to look to know, my boy… I can work out the details just fine. The noise is hard to ignore, too. I'm not deaf. All of this does not concern you.
6192355001097763 So why do the 凯恩s want my family home?
6192355001097762 Do you have any idea how much I lose after every single day of downtime? If I've stopped the Factory, that means I've had very good reasons for doing so! \nMind your test tubes and surgical instruments, Master 布拉克… And keep your nose out of my affairs. I handle my business just as well as you handle yours… You mind that!
6192355000858256 Plenty. 谢谢你 for your counsel.
6192355000998852 There's some sort of trouble brewing in the Hindquarters and around.
6192355000998855 I'm ready to sell you the house, 牛老大.
6192355000858255 Any luck with the house, Master 布拉克?
6192355000998854 I don't know. Everyone's confused.
6192355000998859 Whatever it is, people are suffering out there.
6192355000998853 I'm aware… Yes, I'm aware of that, my boy. \nWhat's going on in the Hindquarters? What's that floating dirt folk babble on about? My Factory doesn't fume like that, no… I keep my property nice and tidy.
6192355000998857 I thought you gave me your word.
6192355000998858 Very well. I'm not in a hurry.
6192355000998856 Glad to hear it. We'll speak about this later.
6192355000996452 Were you the person who left my 父亲 a note? It was attached to a key.
6192355001007059 …No, nothing. I just realized I'm talking to the wrong man.
6192355000996451 I'm listening.
6192355001007052 Well, it was signed with your initials, and I thought…
6192355001007053 Just a guess.
6192355001007051 What made you think so?
6192355001007055 Yes.
6192355001007060 Signed "V.O."
6192355001007054 So there was a key, huh?
6192355001007057 Don't. I'm sorry I bothered you.
6192355001007058 Not every key in this town is yours to throw around, 牛老大.
6192355001007056 I don't throw keys around… I keep them close. Your 父亲 had his own house, and he never locked it… Always open… Unafraid of thieves…\n谢谢你, Master 布拉克, for letting me know. I'll be sure to investigate… this mysterious key.
6192355001007062 How is it a bad thing?
6192355001007063 So that was your son, huh? Also a 维拉德 奥吉姆斯基…
6192355001007061 More than one person in the world happens to have these initials… but not all of them have keys to spare. \nI think I know who V. O. is. Ugh… Indeed that son of mine is punishment from God… plotting behind my back now… but I'll get to him.
6192355001312966 Your wife…
6192355001490263 You robbed yourself.
6192355001490264 You're not alone yet. You have people who can take care of you.
6192355001312965 Did you come to gawk? That's all right… all right… Here I stand. I stood my ground this whole life… and I'll stand now. Fate has robbed me of my wife and children, and now… well…\nI wonder what my old age will be like… Yes. But you haven't left me… I know you haven't…
6192355001490260 Are you thinking about death?
6192355001490267 Dignity. That's a good word.
6192355001490259 I could tear anyone's throat out… Anyone… but now…\nLook at me, Master 布拉克… A colossus with feet of clay. Heh heh… standing here, imagining my end. I still need to finish… with dignity…
6192355001490262 People say right.
6192355001490269 I've got nothing to tell you.
6192355001490261 That's what I think. People say… a life for a life… I took the Kin's life, but I never gave up mine…
6192354999924751 大维拉德
6192355001258453 大维拉德
6192354999870023 你是谁？
6192354999870024 你好，贼。
6192354999870022 知道她把面包放哪儿了吗？架子是空的。
6192354999870026 你想要什么？
6192354999870027 No. There's a sinister look in your eyes.
6192354999870025 亲密的朋友或苦涩的敌人。取决于你的选择。所以——朋友？
6192354999870029 No, I don't.
6192354999870030 Of course. Can you see my future?
6192354999870028 Do you believe in divination, 布拉克?
6192354999870032 …I'm going to dis格蕾丝 myself?
6192354999870033 Picture perfect.
6192354999870031 Well, that makes things harder. Because you're going to do something awful, and I could have saved you the dis格蕾丝.\nBut I guess you'd rather stay gloomy, self-centered, and bull-headed… Am I right?
6192354999870035 So, a bite of toast and you'll wave your hands and fix everything? Or do you take coin?
6192354999870036 I don't understand.
6192354999870034 You'll spill a ton of blood, 布拉克. Tremendous amounts. A river of blood. Family blood. Beloved blood. You will drown this town in blood, and soon. Unless you trust me.
6192354999870038 …What are you going to do?
6192354999870039 You're good at chin music, I'll give you that. But your actual words are bullshit.
6192354999870037 Listen to me. You need to leave town. Now. If you must stay—lay low, do nothing. The less you do, the less 格里夫 you'll bring to those around you. \nAbandon your schemes. I'll handle it on my own. It'll be glorious. You'll see.
6192354999870041 Prove it.
6192354999870040 Whatever it takes. It's all going to hell, and soon… We're halfway there now. \nJust stay still. Trust me, will you? I'm your sister. Your double. And I know what must be done. I know a great deal, 布拉克. The future is open to me.
6192354999870043 Not buying it. And I think you should get going. The mistress of the house is getting anxious.
6192354999870044 Listen up, because I'll only say this once. If I ever catch you here again, I might get angry. And if you cross me, it'll be your blood that begins this. How's that for prophecy?
6192354999870045 I'll think about it.
6192354999870042 Your life lessons will prove me right. But heed my words: Whenever you want to do something, don't. You'll just make it worse. You'll be the demise of your hometown. You'll drown it with blood.
6192354999870047 Sort of. I'm 一个外科医生。
6192354999870048 How am I a ripper?
6192354999870046 Says a ripper.
6192354999870050 I'm no hero, but I'm not a villain. Much less <i>the</i> villain.
6192354999870051 Well, what can I see in you, mirror, mirror on the wall?
6192354999870049 I have many faces. Perhaps this one is sinister, yes. But that's 'cause you're the villain. I'm only a mirror.
6192354999870053 Go ahead, then!
6192354999870052 I can.
6192354999870055 No, it's mine. I'm a doctor.
6192354999870056 Fine. Let's go. I'll introduce you to this house's owner. She's convinced there's a rat running around.
6192354999870054 It's simple, idiot. Whatever you wanted to do, don't. Drop your plans. You aren't bringing your 父亲 back. Saving lives is my business.
6192354999870058 Are you going to leave or do I need to throw you out?
6192354999870059 Want to bet?
6192354999870057 As am I. A better one than you.
6192354999870061 I had the strangest dream. Was it your doing?
6192354999870062 I'm not that fast a thinker.
6192354999870063 I did. My answer's no.
6192354999870060 Have you thought about what I told you?
6192354999870065 Don't you want to know what I dreamed of?
6192354999870066 Ugh… What's wrong with me? It's just a bad dream.
6192354999870064 No. Yours.
6192354999870068 I'm not some monster, myself… Are you sure it was prophetic?
6192354999870069 So you know how to hypnotize people, then?
6192354999870067 Of horror, I'm sure. All dreams are prophetic. And since <i>you</i> dreamed it, you must have seen yourself spill blood. As for the details, spare me. My nerves are delicate.
6192354999870071 I'm a steppe man, and we believe in fate. You can't run from fate.
6192354999870072 Nothing's doubtless.
6192354999870073 So you say you have a gift, huh? Well, I do too. I can sense when I'm being lied to. Like right now.
6192354999870070 It was prophetic. No doubt about that.
6192354999870075 My war is here.
6192354999870076 Maybe I will.
6192354999870074 …Hypno-what? What does that mean? But I can do many things. It's not about what I can do, though: It's about what I'm telling you. Heed my warning, 布拉克. Leave this place.\nYour dreams will grow lighter when you do. Or maybe go enlist. War could always use a person like you.
6192354999870078 洗耳恭听。
6192354999870079 谁？
6192354999870080 Begone, wraith.你只是个幻觉而已。
6192354999870077 你知道为什么大地不肯接纳他吗？
6192354999870082 你到底知不知道你在哔哔什么，你这个讨厌的怪物？
6192354999870083 什么？那个女孩是看守人？
6192354999870081 你的父亲。大地像对待异乡的尸体一样驱逐了他。看见那个女孩格蕾丝了？看守人?她已经绝望了。 我认为她愿意代替他在坟墓中的位置，如果她能够的话。
6192354999870085 你怎么知道的？你只在这待了几天。 
6192354999870086 我想你现在最好把嘴巴闭上，否则我就把你撕成碎片。
6192354999870084 有些人是编织者，他们建立联系。其他人是切割者，他们把切断事情。 \ n你的父亲属于后者。你们布拉克享有这项特权，不是吗？你们在当地人中很重要。作为一名尽职的外科医生，如果必须要的话，他会切断一个活生生的小镇，甚至用双手将它撕成碎片。一个暴力的男人。
6192354999870088 菌丝体？和它们有什么关系？ 
6192354999870089 别把我父亲搅进来。
6192354999870087 我就是知道。因为我了解人们，我知道如何倾听他们。我知道如何连接。但是你的父亲是一个切割者。他拆毁了整个菌丝体。
6192354999870091 那么继续吧。看起来我没法阻止你。
6192354999870092 所以你不是个外科医生，对吗？
6192354999870090 人类的菌丝体。小镇的菌丝体。他相信是共生体出了问题。 \ n就像你们的外科医生一样......如果断了的骨头没接好，你只需再次折断它，再切断组织！谁会那样做？我可以用不同的方法 。
6192354999870094 没错。我为什么会明白？
6192354999870095 我不相信超自然力量。
6192354999870093 我不是。我不和骨头与肉打交道。我专长于更细微的事情。灵魂。感受。你不明白的。
6192354999870097 所以她才是我需要对话的人。
6192354999870098 我明白了。 你在和我父亲对话?
6192354999870096 Uh huh.
6192354999870100 你是谁？
6192354999870101 
6192354999870099 You know why walk all hunched? That's because you're carrying on your shoulders the burden of all the evils you are about to commit.
6192354999870103 你想要的什么？
6192354999870104 No. I don't like you, girl. You have a sinister look in your eyes.
6192354999870102 Either your best friend or your worst enemy. Depends on you. So, friends?
6192354999870106 No, I don't.
6192354999870107 明显是的。你能预知命运吗？
6192354999870108 
6192354999870105 Do you believe in fortune-telling, 布拉克?
6192354999870110 So what is the dis格蕾丝ful thing that I'm about to do?
6192354999870111 Spot on. It's like you're reading my mind.
6192354999870109 Ugh... That complicates things. 'Cause you're about to do something horrible, and I could have spared you the dis格蕾丝.\nYou must be a gloomy, self-absorbed, bull-headed man... amd I right?
6192354999870113 So... A cracker or two and you'll magically fix everything, right? Or do you accept coin?
6192354999870114 What is this supposed to mean?
6192354999870115 Enough. I get the gist. Let's assume we're well acquainted.
6192354999870112 You will spill a lot of blood, 布拉克. An awful lot of it. A river of blood. Dear blood. Beloved blood. You will literally drown your hometown in blood, and soon. Unless you trust me.
6192354999870117 ...You'll do what?
6192354999870118 Well, you're good at making chin music, I'll grant you that. But what you're saying is bullshit.
6192354999870116 Listen here. Leave the town right now. And if you insist on staying, just lay low and don't do anything. The less you do, the less 格里夫 you'll bring to the people around you. Abandon your plans. I'll do everything myself. It'll be great, you'll see.
6192354999870120 Prove it.
6192354999870119 What it takes. It will all go to hell soon... it's on its way already. Just stay put. Trust me, 'kay? I'm your sister. Your counterpart. And I know what must be done. I know a lot, 布拉克. The future is an open book to me.
6192354999870122 Not convinced. And I think it's time you took your leave.
6192354999870123 So this is how it's going to be: if I see you again, I might just get angry. And if you get in my way, it'll be your blood that everything starts with. Seeing how it's been foretold and everything.
6192354999870124 I'll consider it.
6192354999870121 Life will be my proof. Just remember: whenever you feel like doing something, don't. You will only make things worse. You will be the demise of your hometown. You will drown it in blood.
6192354999870126 Of a kind. I'm 一个外科医生。
6192354999870127 Ripper? How am I a ripper?
6192354999870125 Says the ripper.
6192354999870129 I may not be the best person in the world, but I'm not a villain, much less THE villain.
6192354999870130 Well... So what say you, mirror mirror on the wall?
6192354999870128 I have a lot of looks. This one may be sinister, yes. That's 'cause you're the villain. I am but a mirror.
6192354999870132 Shoot!
6192354999870131 I can.
6192354999870134 No, it's mine. I'm a doctor.
6192354999870135 All right, whatever. Let's go, I'll introduce you to the owner of the house. She's been wondering if there was a rat upstairs.
6192354999870133 It's supposed to mean this. Whatever you were planning to do, don't. Cancel your plans. You won't bring your 父亲 back. And saving lives is my business.
6192354999870137 
6192354999870138 Want to bet?
6192354999870136 So am I. And a better one than you.
6192354999870169 You can have a go at him too, if you like.
6192354999870170 Smartass?
6192354999870168 Useless. Pointless. Smartass will be the end of him. So will you. Poor Patches…
6192354999870172 I wonder why…
6192354999870173 Why, I wonder?
6192354999870171 …诺克金不会让我这么做的。
6192354999870175 Why are you even here?
6192354999870174 The 学者. The learned goon. Self-absorbed, self-assured… and a total unbeliever. People like him do the most harm.
6192354999870177 Why didn't you, then?
6192354999870176 I just wanted to help.
6192354999870179 He shouldn't.
6192354999870180 I'll deal with him myself. Maybe something will come of it.
6192354999870181 I wouldn't trust you with my life, either.
6192354999870178 They don't believe in me. They don't believe I'm a miracle worker… As they have believed, so shall it be done for them. But then why should the boy suffer?
6192354999870183 不。我有其他主意了。
6192354999870184 I'll do it my 父亲's way. He could cure without cutting.
6192354999870185 I'd rather cut out yours. I'm curious about it.
6192354999870182 How about you just… don't? You'll only make it worse. Doctor Smartass would smother him with medicine. You… what'll you do, cut his heart out? Ripper…
6192355000441861 Yes… It was…
6192355000441859 嘴巴放干净点！
6192355000441860 你是谁？告诉我！ 
6192355000441858 …And something with a will and an agenda can be bargained with. Like Mistress Sand Plague. That was your silly hope, was it?
6192355000441864 Imagine your child told you a boogeyman knocks on her window at night. I'd rather check, just in case, than regret it for life.
6192355001232454 You're a shapeshifter, after all. I just feel it. Someone wears you like a glove.
6192355000441862 That's what makes the plague so terrible, you fool! \nYou can't reason with it. There's no method behind it, no mind. No negotiation. There's only death—and if it has a voice, it's yours. Your own voice!
6192355000465540 So you're 穆克's friend?
6192355000465546 That's what I thought: If the plague has a form, it must resemble you.
6192355000465547 I need to check on something… in order to protect that girl over there.
6192355000465539 What do you want, 布拉克? Why are you here? Go do your job, tinkerer! Have you already avenged your 父亲? Come into your inheritance? Saved everyone on the list? Visited the Kin? Have you made a cure?
6192355000465542 I'm the one keeping her from the plague. And I have my doubts about you.
6192355000465548 What do you mean I can't? I can.
6192355000465549 I think the plague has been talking to her for the last few days.
6192355000465541 Are you dense? You idiot… I'm keeping 穆克 from the plague. Do you understand? I'm doing it because you can't even watch over one child!
6192355000465544 That's about it.
6192355000465545 How do you know all this?
6192355001232455 You're a good judge of character…
6192355000465543 I thought you were a grown man, 布拉克. Did you honestly come to believe the disease has a mind, a goal, some agenda? That it walks on clay legs and talks to 穆克? That it'll come here to tell you something?
6192355001232452 I don't know. I'm not sure. Everything's possible.
6192355001232453 No, I'm doing what an adult must, trying to get to the bottom of all this.
6192355001232451 Ugh, back to square one. You think I'm some kind of avatar for the plague? What's wrong with you?! Are you still a child?
6192355001233358 Yeah, right. What could be simpler than slaying a monster?
6192355001233363 Hanging the cure over my head? You think I've made no progress?
6192355001233364 That's unfair of you.
6192355001233357 You don't believe me… You don't want to. Fine. Be my guest. Check.\nYou want an easy answer, don't you? You want a monster you can drive a stake into, or bargain with… That'd be so heroic, wouldn't it? And so much simpler than the hard work of discovering a cure.
6192355001233360 But who was 穆克 talking to?
6192355001233365 Fair enough… Thanks for setting me straight.
6192355001233359 Work, 布拉克! Forget this child's play! Steppe miracles, childhood mysteries… Leave them to me. Step aside, and deal in earthly matters.\nGo! Work! Deal with your damn town! You're the one who must figure out what it's made of.
6192355001233367 Yeah… You're right. Go. I'll take 穆克 home.
6192355001233368 Kids deserve trust, or bad things happen. I know from experience.
6192355001233366 穆克 talks to rocks and herbs. 穆克 was raised by steppe wolves. She's a wolf cub herself. Why would you ever take her words seriously?
6192355000550185 What do you mean?
6192355000550186 What are you doing here?
6192355000550184 Cat's out of the bag now.
6192355001490580 What results?
6192355000550187 I sympathize with the 奥吉姆斯基, I do. But the 父亲 and son were too different, you see. Incompatible. Hence the catastrophe.\nIt's always like that with them… with this town, too. The gears grind; they can't move in harmony. And we see the results…
6192355000550190 What makes you think only one of them will survive?
6192355001490587 What makes you think we're the ones making these choices?
6192355000550189 Time sets everything in its place. Each had his own vision of the Bull Enterprise… They got in each other's way, the 父亲 and son. Now there will be calm, and the gears will turn as before.\nBut <i>为什么？</i> Why does calm have to come at such a steep price…? To hell with that damned Factory! But why do we have to make these unbearable choices?
6192355000550192 Young 维拉德 decided to go to the Termitary? 为什么？
6192355001490594 I wish they'd both rot. Bloodsuckers, both of them, each in their own way.
6192355000550191 One of them must go to the Termitary. And I think it'll be the Younger. He's firmly decided.\nBut I went to the Elder… I think it's better for him to go, rather than the Younger. If I were him, I'd go in my son's stead… But no one would let me speak to him…
6192355000550194 Were you the one who told him about the Termitary?
6192355000550198 Is he at his place? I'll talk him out of it myself.
6192355001490595 You're good at guilt-tripping people, girl saint.
6192355000550193 His conscience. I was just with him—I spoke to him. About everything…\nIn the end, he's going. How can I stop him? I'm sorry it happened this way… I shouldn't have paid him that visit.
6192355000550196 I'm familiar with your sort of "comfort." You make everyone feel guilty.
6192355000550197 You witch… You probably pushed him to do it in the first place!
6192355000550195 He'd have found out anyway. He was keeping a close eye on it. If not today, tomorrow.\nI thought it would be better if he learned it from me. I wanted to comfort him. It wasn't his fault.
6192355000550200 I bet you haven't even tried.
6192355000550201 I'll get there in time.
6192355000550202 That's all right. I have a better idea…
6192355000550199 Like hell you will! If even <i>I</i> failed…\nAnd you won't get there in time, anyway. He's already on his way.
6192355001490582 What do you mean…?
6192355001490581 The son killed several thousand people. And he knows it. He was the one who locked up the Termitary.
6192355001490584 …
6192355001490585 …为什么？
6192355001647071 He mentioned a riot brewing there...
6192355001490583 I mean what I said. He's the one who did it. On the night of your arrival.
6192355001490589 The 奥吉姆斯基 themselves.
6192355001490590 Fair enough.
6192355001490588 Who else?
6192355001490592 Yeah, I'm in stitches.
6192355001490593 So what do we do…?
6192355001490591 Very funny.
6192355001490597 我会亲自去和小维拉德说。And talk him out of it.
6192355001490596 Why would you say that? I'm a good person—a <i>good person!</i>
6192355001599583 Nothing.
6192355001599585 His intentions still matter.
6192355001599582 I don't know. He hardly expected things to go south so quickly… and I don't think he knew about the plague. Only, what does it matter now?
6192355001435729 I'm not sure… I guess you're right, that this is what I wanted.
6192355001435730 Fair enough… I wanted life to go on. So it does.
6192355001435728 Why do you have that ridiculous grin on your face? What are you looking at? Isn't this what you wanted? Isn't this why you preserved the Town's seeds? There will be a harvest soon. It won't be long.
6192355001435732 It's nice to be appreciated.
6192355001435735 God forbid.
6192355001435731 You know, Ripper… You're not such a bad person. There was no love lost between you and my parents, but you helped them anyway. It's hard to protect someone you don't like. Harder than saving cubs. \nSo don't wander too far. We're still connected, you and I. And there's a great deal ahead of us.
6192355001435734 It's nice to be appreciated.
6192355001435736 God forbid.
6192355001435733 You know, Ripper… You aren't such a bad person. You didn't even hesitate when you took that awful poison to protect the orphan girl. By the Crowstone, remember? That was very brave.\nSo don't wander too far. We're still connected, you and I. And there's a great deal ahead of us.
6192355001435738 I can.
6192355001435739 I can't.
6192355001435737 Now go. What will happen here is not for your eyes. Someone's waiting for you elsewhere. Can't you hear?
6192355001442983 Isn't it a bit too crowded?
6192355001442986 So you plan to become a Mistress yourself?
6192355001442989 Aren't you a bit young to be Mistresses?
6192355001442982 See? All the Mistresses are here.
6192355001442985 Why are you here?
6192355001442999 Even two were too many.
6192355001442984 It's perfect.
6192355001442988 What are you good at?
6192355001442987 I guess… Think I'll fail?
6192355001442991 You're right.
6192355001442992 It's… it's different.
6192355001442990 Divination. I told your fortune, didn't I? That you'd spill rivers of blood? And you did… Drowned the whole square in it. Am I wrong?
6192355001442994 I never wanted to…
6192355001443002 So what are you doing here? Partitioning out domains?
6192355001442993 No it isn't.
6192355001442996 That's some complex diplomacy, girls.
6192355001443003 All right. Play Mistresses. Can't see any harm in this game.
6192355001442995 Just… getting to know each other. Each came here seemingly spontaneously, each for her own reasons, spurred by her own thoughts… But in truth, we're getting to know each other.
6192355001442998 But <i>what</i> will I see?
6192355001443004 Enough miracles. Enough for a lifetime.
6192355001442997 We aren't <i>girls.</i> We're Mistresses. In a couple years, you'll see.
6192355001443001 Why not?
6192355001443000 That's not for you to judge.
6192355001443006 No.
6192355001443007 What are you doing here?
6192355001443005 You did.
6192355001445152 Divination's easy in hindsight.
6192355001445153 It's… it's different.
6192355001445151 Divination. I saw your… rivers of blood too. And you spilled them. Drowned the whole square. So I was right, wasn't I?
6192355000776055 There's blood on your hands.
6192355001338122 You think so?
6192355000776054 Anyone can be understood. Anyone can be forgiven. Even oneself…
6192355001338107 Are all these corpses your fault?
6192355001344559 How do you do it? Do you have some sort of evil eye, where you can kill people just by looking at them?
6192355001338106 Yes.
6192355001338109 How did you kill so many 士兵s?
6192355001344562 See? You're confessing, all on your own!
6192355001338108 Yes…
6192355001338113 So how many have you healed?
6192355001338114 What an amazing act of healing. There must be at least twelve corpses here.
6192355001344564 So you came when it was already over? Who won? Where's the general?
6192355001338112 There was a fight. The commander's 士兵s cornered a group of mutineers, demanded they lay down their arms. The mutineers began to shoot. Look! All those wounds are from bullets…\nI was following the general. Heard the shooting. Came here, tried to heal them. I have a healing touch—didn't you know?
6192355001338116 Three hundred?!
6192355001338117 That's like thirty times more than I have.
6192355001338115 Over the course of… what, eleven days? Three hundred or so… I haven't counted. But today… today I couldn't heal anyone. I was late…
6192355001652985 Not yet.
6192355001338118 But you can save so many more. You have the panacea.
6192355001338124 Still. Their death is your fault.
6192355001338123 I know.
6192355001652987 No. Now is not the time to discuss feeling. Tell me, have you seen a courier carrying papers to the general?
6192355001652988 I... I can't put it into words. Perhaps you can do it better?
6192355001652989 I was doing everything wrong all these days, you see. As if hoping for a miracle...
6192355001338126 Are you scared? Try telling me more. It'll help me understand myself, too.
6192355001338129 I think I was counting on a miracle. Expecting the Town itself to aid me…
6192355001338132 I don't know how to explain. Maybe you can do it better.
6192355001338128 为什么？
6192355001338138 It felt like the Town would inevitably save itself… Just because it's so <i>big.</i> And big means strong, right?
6192355001338139 I believed that the solution was there, and all I had to do was find it.
6192355001652991 No. We must save ourselves—by acting. It's clear to me now. Have you seen a courier with papers around?
6192355001338130 Well, of course! Only miracles can save us. I've always said that…
6192355001338134 为什么？
6192355001338133 No, please, keep talking. You have to keep talking…
6192355001338136 What's the truth?
6192355001338137 "Nothing rings truer than a lie," huh?
6192355001338135 It'll help you figure out the truth.
6192355001344578 Maybe. Now tell me. There was a courier following the general…
6192355001338140 Well, maybe it's true?
6192355001338143 I'll tear the thorn from Earth's body. The Tower must be destroyed.
6192355001338144 I'll debilitate the Town… to protect what little of itself remains. To give it a future, of a sort.
6192355001338145 I'll spill rivers of blood… as was foretold. All 布拉克s break bones, rend tissue, and vivisect still-living organs. A 布拉克 must spill blood.
6192355001499760 No, I don't. It's not that simple. I still have some time to think.
6192355001338142 You know what you need to do, don't you? I can tell you do. You said so yourself.
6192355001338147 I will.
6192355001499761 I won't.
6192355001499762 Don't push it!
6192355001338146 You said it yourself. You know what you have to do. So do it. Such is your fate.\nI guess that's the only way to overcome it: acceptance and understanding. Without understanding, you would be enslaved by it—but now? You might actually master it. And life will continue. And there will be a future.\nYou'll do it. Won't you?
6192355001344552 为什么？
6192355001344551 I've failed utterly. I think I've lost all my powers.
6192355001344554 Yeah, right. That good book of yours got any more wisdom?
6192355001344555 Next you'll say it wasn't you.
6192355001344558 What happened here?
6192355001344553 Don't judge anyone. Don't punish anyone.
6192355001344557 Wasn't it, sister death?
6192355001344556 It <i>wasn't</i> me…
6192355001344561 Don't you deserve it?
6192355001344563 "Don't judge anyone. Don't punish anyone." Right?
6192355001344560 …Why are you like this?
6192355001344566 Tell me: 你是谁？
6192355001344565 I don't know…
6192355001344568 And modest, too.
6192355001344571 Sure it's not the devil?
6192355001344567 I'm a child of God. God reveals himself to people by my hands.
6192355001344570 Have you really been saving people? How many have you cured?
6192355001344569 I don't know anything anymore. My faith is gone. It used to be so firm. And people believed in me, too—no one doubted my sainthood. But now, I'm just not sure…
6192355001344574 I may know the way. Only it's horrible.
6192355001344576 Have I? I know now that the world is very different from how I saw it before. But what if I'm still missing something?
6192355001652986 You're right. I know what to do. And for that, I need to find a courier carrying orders from the 审判官. Have you seen him?
6192355001344573 Not yet... But you've figured it out, haven't you? You know how to make the cure?
6192355001344582 You mean I'll miraculously discover the truth just by talking?
6192355001652990 The truth is, a choice will have to be made—whether I want it or not. Have you seen a courier carrying papers around?
6192355001344581 You tell me.
6192355001344584 What? In the water? So the papers are destroyed…
6192355001344583 You mean the one in the water over there? He didn't drown—he was shot, too. Otherwise I could have…
6192355001344586 That's all right. He's not the last courier. But I need to hurry…
6192355001344587 They were meant to persuade your general to fire in the right direction.
6192355001344588 Forget it. Guess it's fate.
6192355001344585 Are they important, those papers?
6192355001665453 And what exactly will you do? Read them from your good book? No. I have no choice but to protect you.
6192355001665455 Are they coming for you?
6192355001665452 Good people don't shoot innocents.
6192355001665454 Thanks for the warning, I guess.
6192355001665451 And one more thing...\nIn a moment, a group of 士兵s will come here. If they see you, they'll shoot. They're not bad people! It's just... just... how it is.\nDon't attack them, all right? I'll deal with them myself. It's going to be fine, no one has to die... <i>if</i> you just leave this place quietly.
6192355001665457 Yes... I am about to spill different blood.
6192355001665458 We'll see.
6192355001665456 It's all because of me... I've done that to them. But they won't hurt me.\nPlease, if there is a sliver of trust in you, just leave! You can't talk to them, there's no other solution, only fight or flight! And there's no need to spill more blood...
6192355000934590 No, you can't. You were rude to me.
6192355000934591 What was the task?
6192355000934589 Hey, can I copy your homework?
6192355000934593 Don't you know it all in advance?
6192355000934594 Don't worry. She won't check yours today.
6192355000934592 The rules of life, as always.
6192355000934596 Sure.
6192355000934597 No.
6192355000934598 Shall we meet after the class?
6192355000934595 Want a gingerbread?
6192355000934600 I don't know…
6192355000934601 Why was 丹尼尔 punished?
6192355000934599 Why are you so grown up, anyway? How'd they let you into the school?
6192355000934603 Wow… Bold of him.
6192355000934604 Well, it's true.
6192355000934602 He told her she doesn't know how to play and only ruins it all.
6192355001095052 So what?
6192355001107375 How do you know?
6192355001192051 Oh for the love of… How could you know <i>that?</i> Your talents include seeing the future <i>and</i> what's in my pockets?
6192355001095051 …You've got a shmowder on you.
6192355001095056 I have, actually. They're out of order.
6192355001095059 Do we have time for that?
6192355001107385 How do you know?
6192355001095055 Fancy yourself a healer already? Have you mastered the potions your 父亲 made? You haven't even found his tools yet!
6192355001095058 I see.
6192355001107379 Calm down. I believe you.
6192355001697053 All kinds of things happen...
6192355001095057 It's not a toy. It's poison!\nLet me tell you a story. Several years ago, these kids were playing plague. They gathered a pile of pills, ground them up and mixed them… That's where shmowders came from. \nThen, a terrible outbreak happened. Some people believed children's shmowders helped. But they couldn't have! That was their desperation talking!
6192355001095061 I can. But getting them to work will take time, and the kid needs help right now.
6192355001095060 Can't you fix them…?
6192355001095063 How do you know?
6192355001095062 A little. Unless someone interferes, he'll die at seven o'clock.
6192355001107374 You think I'm insane? It's not medicine, just a thing kids play with.
6192355001697052 Can it help?
6192355001107378 I'm not. I'll treat him with normal medicine.
6192355001107373 You're not planning on giving it to Patches, right? It might kill him, you know.
6192355001107377 You got me, I've got a shmowder. What now?
6192355001107376 I can sense that foul stench a mile away.
6192355001107381 Calm the hell down.
6192355001107382 Not now. But perhaps one day I will test one on myself.
6192355001107380 Not to mention they're terrible for your health! You know the only time people eat a pile of random pills? When they want to kill themselves! You don't even know what it's made of.\nLeave the boy alone. If you're so keen on poisoning someone, eat it yourself.
6192355001107407 All right, I'm convinced. Sit tight, I'll be back soon.
6192355001107384 There's no time. I'll have to guess. By the way, why are you even here?
6192355001107406 "We have time"? Can't you help him now? Don't you have healing hands, or something? 
6192355001107383 Trust me, please. We have time, at least until seven. Go and prepare the right medicine. \nIt's not like I know anything about your 父亲's craft. It's just that I feel that you need to do as he did. To do otherwise will invite great sorrow.
6192355001107387 You're weird, you know that? And yet, somehow, this once, I genuinely want to trust you.
6192355001107386 I have a gift for seeing things.
6192355001107392 I wonder why…
6192355001107393 Why, I wonder?
6192355001107391 …诺克金 wouldn't let me.
6192355001107397 Why didn't you, then?
6192355001107396 I wanted to help.
6192355001107399 He shouldn't.
6192355001107400 I'll take care of him myself. Maybe something will come of it.
6192355001107401 I wouldn't trust you with my life either.
6192355001107398 They don't believe in me. They don't believe I'm a miracle worker… As they have believed, so shall it be done for them. But then why should the boy suffer?
6192355001107403 No. I have another idea.
6192355001107404 I'll do it my 父亲's way. He could cure without cutting.
6192355001107405 I'd rather cut out yours. I'm curious about it.
6192355001107402 How about you just… don't? You'll only make it worse. You… what'll you do, cut his heart out? Ripper…
6192355001109554 It's not like you to care about my well-being.
6192355001109558 I'm not going to lie—I could use some rest.
6192355001109553 Are you well yourself? You must be dead tired.
6192355001109556 Nah, I don't hate you. You have a good heart, I think.
6192355001109562 You're trying to swindle me right now.
6192355001109563 How do I put it… You're weird. Suspicious. And always different.
6192355001109555 Do you think I'm out to cheat or swindle you? You hate me. Everyone hates me. It's okay, I'm used to being hated… but that doesn't make me the villain. \nTrust your heart, not your head. What do you think of me?
6192355001109560 A gift? From you? You must be joking.
6192355001109561 Sure.
6192355001109559 You gotta stay awake until nightfall. Today is very, very, very important. It's going to be hard to stay awake, but you can make it. Coffee staves off sleep. Want some?
6192355001232467 It's connected to Earth somehow.
6192355001232468 People say it didn't start on its own, that there's some scheme behind it.
6192355001232469 I do know not everyone dies from it. Some folks are beyond its reach.
6192355001232470 You're right, I still don't know enough. I don't understand the world I live in.
6192355001232466 All right. Let's try this. Your 穆克 is still on her way. I can sense her. She might get stranded, after all—these things happen.\nLet's test you, then. What do you know of the sand pest? Tell me!
6192355001232472 Deal. But leave 穆克 alone. And never touch her again!
6192355001232473 I'd say you're a horrible person. And useless. Forget it.
6192355001232471 If you agree to this, your 穆克 might live longer. And her friend will, from now on, address you directly—no middlemen, no interference.\nWhat say you, oh brave ripper?
6192355001232486 Surely she's home now. Or maybe in that lonely train car…
6192355001232487 Oh, shut it. You're lying, as always.
6192355001232485 What a disappointment. Even 穆克 had more curiosity. What is there to talk about? You can't save anyone. Not even yourself.
6192355001233352 Where's 穆克?
6192355001236760 Quit buzzing around like a gnat and get to work!
6192355001233351 I can do many things. Haven't I told you already? I have. Twice, I think. So don't complain now.
6192355001233354 …You're a fast sprinter.
6192355001233369 What kind of trick is this?
6192355001233370 Uh… Did you see 穆克?
6192355001653000 And you said you were no shapeshifter. Said you were good!
6192355001233353 Watch my hands. The right knows not what the left does. The left knows not what the right does. The forepaw doesn't follow the hindpaw; the midfoot, the forefoot; the lower hand, the secret one; the upper hand—the elegant one. \nWhat are you looking at?
6192355001236754 What friend?
6192355001236762 Are you making fun of me? You just told me yourself…
6192355001236753 Walked away from here on her own two feet. \nHer friend came for her. When she learned who her friend was, I think she decided to flee while you were distracted. To protect you, maybe.
6192355001236756 你是谁？你不是克拉拉. It's like you've been… changed.
6192355001236768 I know more than you think.
6192355001236755 Go, 布拉克. 穆克 is beyond your help now. You still don't get it.\nYou think with your fists. You don't understand life, or anything about this disease. How could you protect anyone, ignorant as you are?
6192355001236759 Spin that yarn elsewhere, little trickster. I could snap your neck.
6192355001236761 Where's 穆克?
6192355001236758 No tricks. I've stood here a while, listening in. You're all so funny, so fussy and serious.
6192355001236764 I got it.
6192355001236765 No…
6192355001236763 No, you can't. \nFirst, you swore an oath to never harm little tricksters. Second, I wouldn't let you. Third, I have plenty of necks to spare. Understand?
6192355001236767 Give 穆克 back! You hear me? You…
6192355001236766 I'm the real one. She is the impostor.
6192355001236770 A life for a life, then?
6192355001236771 What's that supposed to mean?
6192355001236772 More traps? No, I'm not in the mood for games. Find another fool.
6192355001236769 Ha. All right, so you're not entirely hopeless. Would you like to understand? You wanted to see 穆克's friend—that, I can arrange.
6192355001288966 I never volunteered to be the first. You're welcome to go on stage yourself.
6192355001420253 Words, words, words.
6192355001288965 One's as bad as the other… and the other, and the other. One thinks he's a head above the rest, but loses heart. The other's light on his feet, but turns a blind eye to everything that matters. And none of you can save everyone.\nPlay it as you like. I'll be the one who cleans up your mess after, anyway.
6192355001314452 What are you talking about?
6192355001451525 Are you and General Block…
6192355001652992 The general said you've changed his mind... did you hypnotize him or something?
6192355001314451 We're having an important conversation. The most important conversation of our lives, maybe. Can you leave us alone?
6192355001410663 The war?
6192355001451532 What do you know about the war? What can you tell him?
6192355001410662 We're talking about the war.
6192355001451527 Then what? Are you trying to convert him?
6192355001451526 No.
6192355001451529 Are you… really a saint?
6192355001451530 Just… don't ever do that to me.
6192355001451531 I didn't know you knew those words.
6192355001652997 He looks transfixed... are you hypnotizing him? How did they even let you in?
6192355001451528 We <i>were</i> talking about the war. Criminal orders. History. Honor. Duty. Truth.\nNow we're talking about words. Will you <i>please</i> leave us alone?
6192355001451534 Fine. I guess I'll just count my blessings…
6192355001451535 Madness…
6192355001652998 You'll have to bear with me some more. I need to talk to him, too.
6192355001451533 Please. You're disturbing us.
6192355001344354 Let me check… They seem fine. Warm.
6192355001418251 Well, they're made of bones.
6192355001344353 I can't feel my legs…
6192355001418253 I don't believe you. You aren't the type to be destroyed so easily.
6192355001418254 Were you really the plague, then?
6192355001418255 Hey, are there… two of you?
6192355001418252 I'm dying, Ripper. Only a tiny drop remains. Like someone cleaved me in half, and it all spilled out.
6192355001418257 The better half, I hope?
6192355001418256 There's only one half of me left.
6192355001418259 Yeah, sure. Blame it on an evil twin.
6192355001418266 …I'm sorry.
6192355001418258 I'm not the plague. Do you still not get it? My sister was… and I'm the good one… Was the good one.
6192355001418261 "Above us"? So who's up there?
6192355001418262 I know all too well.
6192355001418260 You're an idiot, Ripper! A dull, insufferable idiot. All that talk of rivers of blood… that's not what this story was about at all!\nYou have <i>no idea</i> who's up above us! No idea who you <i>actually</i> killed!
6192355001418264 That's fine. You'll sit this one out and find a way to get there.
6192355001418265 Well… Maybe one day I'll figure out <i>your</i> side of the story.
6192355001418263 Someone you weren't even <i>invited</i> to meet! But they're waiting for me… Poor souls… And now I'll never come…
6192355001362380 What sort of Mistress will you be?
6192355001438891 It's not surprising.
6192355001438892 Can you at least tell me now—who <i>are</i> you?
6192355001362379 I'll become a new Mistress. Have you figured it out?
6192355001438887 I meant, the Mistress of what? Mistresses don't exist in isolation. They always have… domains.
6192355001438897 You'd better be. I'm counting on you.
6192355001438886 A good one.
6192355001438889 Yeah, and look how that turned out.
6192355001438890 And it drove her mad.
6192355001438888 Mother was a sole Mistress.
6192355001438894 But… But… Just… Please tell me. Are you even human?
6192355001438893 It's all so very sad, yes. But that's only because she tried to take 妮娜's place. That corrupted her soul and let darkness into her heart. It's because she didn't find her own path first. And I have.
6192355001438896 What kind of human are you?
6192355001438898 Are you really a saint?
6192355001438899 I've been dead certain you're the plague.
6192355001438895 I am.
6192355001438901 Fine. I believe you.
6192355001438902 Nope. Still not convinced.
6192355001438900 It wasn't me. Don't <i>glare</i> at me like that.
6192355001438904 Well… that's what I wanted to hear.
6192355001438907 I hope things work out for you.
6192355001438908 You're still bizarre. But I guess we'll see.
6192355001438903 I don't know if I'm good or evil. Stupid words, anyway… But I'm trying to be gentle to others and hard on myself. I know how to sympathize and not judge. I try to love whoever I touch. That's the only answer I have.
6192355001438906 You don't seem like too kind a person, girl saint.
6192355001438905 You don't seem too excited.
6192355001362382 You think you've found the gate to hell?
6192355001438917 There's a cruel glint in your eye… It's fitting that you're drawn here, to Olonngo, the Ford. You belong here.
6192355001362381 I've thought a lot about one line: "And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." It enthralled me. I wondered how a gate could <i>prevail</i> against anyone. It's just a gate, standing there! Only, I suppose it's not just a gate. And it doesn't just <i>stand.</i> It does something to you.\nI think I'm beginning to see, now.
6192355001438910 Are you saying we've died and don't know it? An old idea… and boring.
6192355001438919 You're free to stay in hell if you want. To be honest, I always felt like that's exactly where you crawled out from.
6192355001438909 We've all been in hell these last few days. And still are, if you didn't notice.
6192355001438912 Bullshit. We're alive. I'm alive. I know that.
6192355001438920 It may not.
6192355001438921 Try jumping down there yourself. Although…no. Bad idea.
6192355001438911 Maybe.
6192355001438916 Wrong. I've been there.
6192355001438918 It's just a throat.
6192355001438915 Yes.
6192355001628052 Did you know him?
6192355001628053 Who am I to force you out?
6192355001628054 You'll just crawl back in anyway.
6192355001628051 I came to pay my last respects to your 父亲. Don't force me out.
6192355001628056 So you're just doing it for appearances.
6192355001628057 Why did you come, then?
6192355001628055 I didn't. He was already dead when I arrived.
6192355001628059 —independent people?
6192355001628060 —actual living humans?
6192355001628058 I talk to people a lot. And they said a lot of good things about your 父亲.\nTalking to people is my greatest skill, you know. They open up. And turn from puppets to—
6192355001628062 Not right now. I don't want to sleep where blood was spilled.
6192355001628063 No. This house is unclean.
6192355001628064 Live here yourself, if you want.
6192355001628061 Are you going to live here now?
6192355001628066 为什么？
6192355001628065 我想理解他。
6192354999901751 换生灵
6192355001271554 换生灵
6192354999870191 我是伊西多·布拉克之子。我叫阿泰米。
6192354999870192 我不是来做生意的。
6192354999870190 你的脸看起来有点眼熟，但我敢肯定我们以前从未见过面。你有什么生意？
6192354999870194 嫉妒? 为什么？
6192354999870193 我向你表示哀悼。还有我的嫉妒。
6192354999870196 不，和你家族做生意的人从前是我父亲。我，恰恰相反，对你知之甚少。
6192354999870197 所以你是维拉德·奥吉姆斯基的儿子。
6192354999870195 朋友，这很难相信。这个镇上的每一个居民都和我有某种生意往来。我就是这么做的。公牛企业不仅仅是工厂、仓库、屠宰场和货运站——它的创建是为了我尊敬的父亲的野心。\n 我猜不知怎么招惹到你了。我说的对吗？
6192354999870199 的确。
6192354999870200 你这么认为？
6192354999870198 你很幸运有个像他一样的父亲。
6192354999870202 伊西多·布拉克.
6192354999870201 那你的父亲是哪位？
6192354999870204 我是阿泰米·布拉克.
6192354999870203 不仅如此，我本身就是一个“维拉德·奥吉姆斯基”。我有幸和谁交谈？
6192354999870206 你怎么知道的？
6192354999870207 关于我 "自己的道路"?恐怕没那么简单。
6192354999870205 伊西多尊重你。他纵容了你想走自己的路的愿望，从未强迫你追随他的脚步。从未尝试过复制自己。
6192354999870209 你似乎消息很灵通。
6192354999870210 我有种感觉你是在对你生活发牢骚，而不是讨论我的。
6192354999870208 当他把你送走的时候，金族人都很生气。他们谴责伊西多把你从根上扯下来。\n 但他总是说，这是让你真正爱你的人民的唯一途径——通过选择，而不是盲目。我从中看到伟大的爱和智慧。
6192354999870212 尼斯湖对此并不感到高兴。
6192354999870211 我在家庭中的地位迫使我密切关注我们这个悲伤的小镇上发生的一切。
6192354999870214 我能理解。
6192354999870215 对我来说，这是一个非常重要的原则。
6192354999870213 你说得对。家族义务对我来说是个痛处。我愿意出一大笔钱，如果能够不再去想它。
6192354999870217 你父亲是镇上最有影响力的人。
6192354999870216 你拥有这样的父亲，我不明白你怎么能这么说。
6192354999870219 好吧。
6192354999870220 不过，你是对的。当前的权力平衡应该受到挑战。我是作为一个金族人的儿子这么说的。
6192354999870218 如果我们不考虑凯恩家和萨普洛夫家，可以说我父亲对这个镇的控制，和他对他那肥胖的钱包的控制一样紧密。可悲的是，他满足于目前的状况，认为事情没有理由改变。他的自满将毁灭我们所有人。\n 事情已经在变化了……但是让我们谈谈别的事情。
6192355000995078 不，我们已经谈过了。不关我的事。
6192355000995079 嘿…真有趣。
6192355000995080 实际上，我很乐意做志愿者。诚实的工作加上必要的犒劳，至少现在是这样。
6192355000995077 顺便说一句，你听说过萨普洛夫在找志愿巡警吗？\n请告诉我不要在你屁股后面再派一个新的突击队。如果知道这个人只想在我们这个被遗弃的村庄里灌输戒严，我会松一口气的。我喜欢了解我的竞争对手的想法。
6192355001360252 好吧。
6192355001360253 不过，你是对的。当前的权力平衡应该受到挑战。我是作为一个金族人的儿子这么说的。
6192355001360251 如果我们不考虑凯恩家和萨普洛夫家，可以说我父亲对这个镇的控制，和他对他那肥胖的钱包的控制一样紧密。可悲的是，他满足于目前的状况，认为事情没有理由改变。他的自满将毁灭我们所有人。\n 事情已经在变化了……但是让我们谈谈别的事情。
6192355001008851 我在父亲家里找到一张便条和一把钥匙。签名“V.O.”是你批准他进入工厂地窖的吗？
6192354999870221 想喝点什么吗？
6192354999870225 显然。
6192354999870226 回答问题，请。
6192355001102152 我怕你的父亲...会知道的。
6192354999870224 为了避免误解，我会直截了当的。这是我们的一个小秘密。如果我父亲发现……假设我有麻烦了吧。\n我想这个地窖现在是你的了，不是吗？
6192354999870228 父亲告诉我更像是奴役。
6192354999870229 是的，这不是什么好笑的事。
6192354999870227 我亲爱的阿泰米……我很感激你是个直率的人，所以我会对你坦诚相待。\n你的人民，或者更确切地说，他们中还剩下的人——整个群里叫“金族”？他们都 <i>属于</i>我的家族。对我父亲来说，金族是一种商品：是公牛企业的劳动力。
6192354999870231 不完全。
6192354999870232 明白。
6192354999870230 哦，我完全同意。好吧，你应该知道我无法谅解我那尊敬的父亲的方法。有一天我<i>会</i> 掌管公牛企业。\n 作为一个富有洞察力和勤奋的老板，我想为我们的工业帝国创造一个更有生产力、更有效率的基础。你明白吗？
6192354999870234 所以你是个慈善家？
6192354999870235 他到底在那里做什么？
6192354999870233 我想重振金族及其…尊严。我喜欢你的传统。它们是不寻常的……几乎是奇迹。我不相信神秘主义，但必须接受显而易见的事实。\n 所以我选择给你父亲一个机会研究其中的一些
6192354999870237 我喜欢你， 维拉德.
6192354999870238 你听起来不真诚。
6192354999870239 设施里有某种……装置。那是什么？
6192354999870236 不，我是个自私自私的人，完全是为了自己的利益行动。奴隶劳动效率低下。在这些无法忍受的工作条件下，金族人们都快死了。\n 我不想成为所有者，管理一个支离破碎，奄奄一息的…好吧，<i>资产，<i>被剥夺了任何繁荣的可能性的资产。请原谅我的愤世嫉俗。
6192354999870241 对...你指的是准则。
6192354999870242 你知道那个装置是怎么工作的吗？
6192354999870240 我不能确定。我去过那地方几次，但从未有机会仔细检查你父亲的工作。我想他是在混合……不寻常的成分。制造某种有机混合物。他有一个关于自然元素及其相互作用的迷人理论……一个普遍的综合假设。
6192354999870244 一言九鼎。我不会冒险破坏它的。
6192354999870245 好的。
6192354999870246 有个顽童已经知道这个地方了。但我会照顾他的。
6192354999870243 不，他自己组装的……我怀疑他是否向任何人解释了它的工作原理。我想你得自己想清楚这一点。\n 记住我之前说过的话——要谨慎。如果有人知道这个地方，我会很不高兴的。明白了吗？
6192354999870248 成交。
6192354999870249 ...如果我还会见到他的话。
6192354999870247 Please do.
6192355000021136 为什么？
6192355000021137 好的，成交。
6192355000021135 啊，布拉克。来的真是时候。这把钥匙完全是你的。它可以打开了3号厂房，一个你父亲曾经工作的地方。请拿着它。只是…不需要公开我们的谈话，好吗？
6192355001008853 哇。你背叛了你父亲？这是怎么发生的？
6192355001008854 我和他谈过了。但我没有透露细节。
6192355001008852 所以你找到了它……我希望你有足够的判断力，不要把它告诉我的父亲，他一个“V.O.”，他恰好拥有这家工厂，所有的地窖和所有的工人。
6192355001102154 你们父子一个名又不是我的错！
6192355001102155 有这么严重吗？
6192355001102153 ...在你的友善帮助下，我猜？
6192355000021077 为什么？
6192355000021078 这对我意味着什么？
6192355000021076 这是一种耻辱……父亲故意把一些我们家族做的肮脏事情赖在我头上。\n 显然没有用足够的食物和药品来补充基金。我在这里的努力是徒劳的!
6192355000021080 这怎么发生的？
6192355000021083 他们会的，如果你问的方法正确。
6192355000021079 挨家挨户抢夺人民的药品和食品储备？疯狂至极。当然，他们不会交出的。他们几乎什么都没有了。
6192355000021082 知道了。早起的鸟儿有虫吃。
6192355000021084 你是个聪明人。你会找到办法的。
6192355000021081 没人知道火车为什么晚点了将近一个月！我们定期装运肉类和兽皮——我们的工资哪去了？常规补给列车在哪里？\n 我们快饿死了。没有存货了。这意味着现在每个人必须自力更生，我必须跪在我父亲面前，对这场惨败负责。
6192355001230951 …你这里，角落里有什么？我的眼睛欺骗了我吗？这房子里真的有井吗？
6192355000193278 布拉克.
6192355000193284 那和你有什么关系？
6192355000193285 他们应该带着沙疫来找我。
6192355000193286 好吧，如果他们不会感染，那他们就走运了。
6192355000193283 …哦，是的。井不是我今天给找你来的原因。\n你看，这里的这些尊敬的人正试图说服我odonghs……嗯，免疫我们的感染。据说他们没有染上沙疫。
6192355000193288 …这样你就可以恢复生产了。
6192355000193289 …然后他们就可以承担一些不愉快的工作。
6192355000193290 …最后，他们将是整个城镇唯一的幸存者。
6192355000193287 你看，我在公牛企业监管某些事情。毕竟，我是一个奥吉姆斯基。\n 我们的工人中有很多是odonghs。几乎所有与牲畜一起工作的人都是odonghs。这是一项艰苦而肮脏的工作。如果他们说的是真的…
6192355000193292 不过，我想我确实需要细节。什么事使你不安？
6192355000193295 好吧。我来看看他们。
6192355000193296 我该怎么区别呢？体检？你在开玩笑。学者才是你要找的人。
6192355000193299 我已经看过了。他们不像我们……但这并不代表任何事。
6192355000193300 是的，他们说的很有道理。我从没见过生病的odongh。
6192355000193291 不完全是，布拉克。不完全是。我在为另一个问题绞尽脑汁…别问我是什么。\ 看着他们告诉我：他们在撒谎吗？或者是真的？毕竟，你——你的父亲是个草原人。
6192355000193298 如你所愿。
6192355000193301 那么，让我们看看你的那些odonghs吧。
6192355000193302 体检是毫无意义的。我会问他们，看看他们说的是不是真的。
6192355000193306 不要相信他们。他们和我们一样。
6192355000193307 我真的相信他们不会生病。他们是chimeras，不是人类。
6192355000193297 现在让我们把话说清楚，布拉克。我喜欢你，我们有共同的兴趣。但我不会和你讨论工厂。我不会讨论我们生意的内部运作。\n 我们的工人是我们的资本。这是我们的家族企业。
6192355001230953 你挖的吗？
6192355001230954 神经病啊。
6192355001230955 但是为什么...?
6192355001230952 你的眼睛没有欺骗你。它，确实，是一口井。
6192355001230957 不，我就是这样长大的。
6192355001230958 你是出于……无聊的好奇心吗？
6192355001230956 是的，是的，我知道。亵渎。禁忌。\n你有没有想过这个迷信背后是什么？
6192355001230960 不足为奇。
6192355001230961 我很惊讶没有暴动。再考虑一下你父亲的脾气…
6192355001230959 事情变了。你不可能没见过对岸的塔吧。\n几年前，父亲还引进了水资源基础设施——真正的管道，布拉克。你没注意到水泵吗？管道甚至都不深，但引发的骚动可以想象。
6192355001230963 解释一下。
6192355001230962 确实如此。如果他们胆敢……\n 你可能会觉得很奇怪，但我在这件事上倾向于普通人的立场。我们不是说过吗？
6192355001230965 所以你发现了什么？
6192355001230968 迷信背后可能<i>有</i>某种东西。我建议你把它埋起来。
6192355001230964 我想看看这些迷信的背后是什么。我一般都很喜欢金族人的民间传说。\n 你看，我相信，通过找出这些人的内在动机，我们可以创造一个真正可靠的经济。帮助他们接受未来，可以说…
6192355001230967 所以…你叫我给我看…这个？
6192355001230966 我还不知道。事情进展不顺利。我们挖得越深，人们就越不愿意继续。不过，还没有出现怪物。
6192355001230970 那么，你今天需要我什么呢？
6192355001230969 当我需要你对这件事的建议时，亲爱的阿泰米，我一定会让你知道。但今天不是时候。\n这是我的事。我的责任。
6192355000193281 对。我相信他们。
6192355000193303 不，我不相信他们。
6192355000193304 他们相信自己说的话。如果这是真的，尽管…
6192355000193305 他们说的很有趣。他们是 chimeras。它们真的是两种物质的混合物。这是事实。但我必须仔细考虑。
6192355000193280 你相信他们吗？在你回答之前，布拉克:我恳求你思考，真正思考。成千上万的生命可能取决于你的答案。
6192355000276295 你提到你学习大草原仪式。“巫毒”这个词对你有什么意义吗？
6192355000276294 很高兴见到你，布拉克.
6192355000276298 和我期待的不一样...
6192355000276299 一个人能被这样称呼吗？
6192355000276297 他们相信公牛的身体反映了宇宙的结构。你的“巫毒”就是这头献祭的公牛。
6192355000276301 困难？
6192355000276302 傲云……我知道名字。他是父亲的朋友。他能帮我吗？
6192355000276300 嗯，这很复杂。对于这些细节我也无能为力。我认识一个精通这类事情的人：弗尔曼·傲云。但有一个……麻烦。6192355000276304 I know all that. So where is he?
6192355000276306 我需要见他。
6192355000276303 屠宰场的弗尔曼。一个足智多谋、可靠的人，甚至是不可替代的。他是一个连接。他帮助我们控制金族人。6192355000276308 Why was the Termitary locked?
6192355000276310 你父亲告诉我，蚁巢是他下令关闭的。但他拒绝解释他的原因。
6192355000276307 我想他和其他金族人被关在蚁巢里了。这意味着你接触不到他。你得等到这场爆发的流行病结束。\n我希望你尽一切努力来结束它。
6192355000276312 是的，一个预防措施？
6192355000276313 继续。
6192355000276311 好，布拉克，既然是你在问这个问题。\n因为一场即将到来的大罢工，蚁巢关闭了。而且，由于我们的劳动力相当……特殊，它将不可避免地成为一场血腥、野蛮的暴乱。你能跟上我思路吗？
6192355000276317 百分之三十？我没听错吧？
6192355000276316 这件事发生在流行病爆发之前，真是幸运之极。对蚁巢的严格封锁变成了一种安全隔离。现在我们可以确定全镇百分之三十都很安全。
6192355000276320 意味着？
6192355000276319 他们是个野蛮人。他们焦躁不安。你知道他们有多容易集体歇斯底里。就像是跳舞热……或是笑病。他们就像一群鸟，如你不介意我这么说的话。\n 不幸的是，蚁巢被挤得太紧了。使问题恶化。
6192355000276322 我要进去。立刻。
6192355000276323 有一个女孩，塔雅…泰吉的女儿。我要确保她没事。
6192355000276324 我需要傲云。
6192355000276321 一次新的人口统计早就应该进行了，但据我所知，蚁巢大约有5000人。是的，条件很难忍受。拥挤，贫穷。但不要把这赖到我家族头上。
6192355000276326 不……不，我不能…。
6192355000276327 我们得想想……
6192355000276325 你让我困惑，布拉克。你是个医生，不是吗？你们所有人都应该理解这些事。\n现在，蚁巢是方舟。安全的堡垒。尽管发生了骚乱，尽管人群拥挤，可能还有饥饿。至少这里有水。\n你能保证你的靴子不会染上瘟疫吗？
6192355001200356 嗯…很有趣。
6192355001200359 对应原则？
6192355001200361 是的，我知道。
6192355001200355 这就是他们对标记待宰杀公牛的称呼。屠宰躯体是岁创造行为的模仿。\n 实际上，我听说这样的仪式将在今天举行。他们从大草原带来了一头公牛，现在他们在街上游行。这是行动中的对应原则。
6192355001200358 嗯…很有趣。
6192355001200360 对应原则
6192355001200357 这就是他们对标记待宰杀公牛的称呼。屠宰躯体是岁创造行为的模仿。\n 实际上，我听说这样的仪式将在今天举行。他们从大草原带来了一头公牛，现在他们在街上游行。这是行动中的对应原则。
6192355000548026 为什么？
6192355000548027 Preparing for your final journey?
6192355000548025 Now is not a good time. I'm headed out.
6192355000548031 I have.
6192355000548032 The Kin are no more.
6192355000548030 Have you heard what happened with the Termitary?
6192355000548034 …What do you mean? <i>You?</i>
6192355000548035 Stop this. They were doomed.
6192355000548033 Leave 父亲 out of this. It was me. I did it.
6192355000548037 Perhaps.
6192355000548044 "If, if, if."
6192355000548036 No, 布拉克, they were not. They could have fled. Could have cured themselves. Could have survived, if they'd had any freedom of movement at all…
6192355000548039 Why did you do it?
6192355000548045 Why did he do it?
6192355001647073 You said the Termitary was locked because of a riot. Was that a lie?
6192355000548038 I ordered the Termitary shut, 布拉克. Not my 父亲. Me. Just before you arrived. 父亲 covered for me later…
6192355000548041 What were you thinking about?
6192355001490601 A riot among the Kin? What the fuck do you mean? They've been struggling under your yoke for sixty years, and they never lifted a finger!
6192355000548040 There was a riot there, or so I was told. Now I understand what scared them… but back then, I wasn't thinking about that at all.
6192355000548043 Why go there? You can't fix anything.
6192355001490605 No one could have known about it… Indeed.
6192355000548042 Back then, I thought 父亲's wrath was the worst possible threat they could face. I was wrong… but no one could have known about this plague!\nI was wrong. But now, I'll make it right. I'll go to them.
6192355000548047 Did you know about the plague? Why did you lock the Termitary?
6192355001647074 You said the Termitary was locked because of a riot. Was that a lie?
6192355000548046 We have a complicated relationship. Haven't I told you already? 父亲 believes that his will the only thing that matters; that all decisions are his own.\nTo his credit, this includes his unpopular decisions, too.
6192355000548050 
6192355000548049 
6192355000550152 They want your 父亲's blood, but they won't refuse yours.
6192355001490606 Don't go. You can't fix this.
6192355001490607 You fucking murderer… Do you even realize what you've done, you monster?
6192355000550151 Why go there… Why go there? <i>Why go there!</i>\nBecause I can't <i>not</i> go, 布拉克. Because this is <i>my</i> doing. Because I must see the place. And look them in the eye.
6192355000550154 Don't go. Please.
6192355000550155 Go. This is the right thing to do.
6192355000550153 All the more reason to go.
6192355001490599 I have.
6192355001490600 Do you realize what you've done? You, and all the 奥吉姆斯基!
6192355001490598 You've been there.
6192355001490603 Yeah… I can.
6192355001490604 What—you think he'd have gunned down a protest? 萨普洛夫 wouldn't have let him! We didn't even have weapons.
6192355001490602 Stop yelling at me! That's just what I've been told! Can you imagine what 父亲 would have done if he'd learned about a strike—not to mention a riot?!
6192355001492428 Fine. If you refuse to listen, I'll find another way to stop you.
6192355001492429 There's four hundred or so…
6192355001490608 This is a brave decision. Go. Look them in the eye.
6192355001492427 布拉克—get out. Just get out. Am I making myself clear?\nBut 谢谢你 for the rehearsal. I've looked one of you in the eyes now. And I must bear… however many there are. I hope there's plenty.
6192355000550157 I'll try.
6192355000550158 It's useless.
6192355000550156 Tell them to leave 父亲 alone.
6192355000550160 You have an odd understanding of duty.
6192355000550161 You're weak. This is the easiest way out.
6192355000550159 Everything is as it should be, 布拉克. As it should.
6192355000550163 What did you plan to do? Educate them?
6192355000550164 你为什么还活着...？
6192355000550162 I truly wanted to be a good master for them, 布拉克. They're a wonderful people… I still believe that.\nThey're not animals. They're… water. 父亲 took them for beasts, so they reflected his expectations. Shifted to fit that shape.
6192355000550166 And turn the屠宰场 back into a temple? Your factory wouldn't have lasted long.
6192355001496566 And put their elders on the town council?
6192355000550165 Are you kidding? It's the other way around.\nI wanted to preserve their culture. Their language. Their rites. To transform the whole business, so it wouldn't… <i>devolve</i> them into cattle!
6192355000550168 Sounds utopian.
6192355000550167 No need for such extremes. Slowly, step by step, I could find a way to make the Kin live in peace with the Town.\nThey could just herd the cattle. We have enough workers, after all.
6192355000550170 Yeah, I've noticed.
6192355001496561 What can I do for you now?
6192355000550169 Yes, 布拉克, it <i>is</i> a utopia. Everyone in this town is trying to build one. Didn't you notice? Everyone is trying to make something new, something no one before them has ever made.
6192355001496559 What's going to happen next?
6192355001496565 In the end, you would have become just like your 父亲. As long as they slaved away for you, everything would have stayed the same.
6192355001496558 I don't know.
6192355001496563 Fine.
6192355001496564 Cheer up. I'll lead them away from here soon. That's why I brought you here in the first place…
6192355001496562 Nothing. It is done already.
6192355000771956 Can you tell me more about your mother?
6192355001392651 True.
6192355000771955 Mother would have approved of my ideas. She loved people. I don't. But I do believe that, when treated with respect, they return it in spades.\nEconomic growth is based on human dignity. And "dignity" is a word that we haven't heard too often around these parts.
6192355001392653 I know.
6192355001392654 我几乎不记得她了。
6192355001392655 …But now it holds on its own.
6192355001392652 No. I don't think the words to describe her exist in any human language. Care? Protection? Concern? Warmth? Regard? Tenderness? Love? This is stupid. And wrong. Wrong.\nPersonally, I've never been too close to her, you know. I guess you could even say I was the only person who did not love her. But it can't be denied that she was the safeguard of this town. She held it together.
6192355001392657 What's your plan, then?
6192355001392656 I never loved my mother. But some things she taught me well, particularly that <i>care</i> is a very smart behavioral strategy. Respect and dignity are the concrete that will hold our new economic foundation together.
6192355001392659 Is that it?
6192355001392660 I can't believe my ears.
6192355001392658 I'll start with simple things. An eight-hour workday. Forbidding child labor. Insurance. Benefits for disabled workers. Better pay.
6192355001392662 Oh, I was being sarcastic. I doubt you'll achieve even a third of that.
6192355001392663 In your place, I'd be more concerned about the commercial landscape.
6192355001392661 Is that not enough?
6192355001392665 No, 维拉德. I'm a doctor, not a manager. My job is different.
6192355001392666 Deal. I'll help you.
6192355001392667 I don't believe you, 维拉德. That sounds like a utopia. It'll never work out.
6192355001392664 I know. I've thought about that, too.\nListen, 布拉克. Would you like to become my assistant? I'll need people to implement my ideas. Especially people like you—people from the Kin. What do you say?
6192355001312964 Self-hatred.
6192355001490255 I don't know. Never thought about it.
6192355001312963 They say that true men are either obeyed, or hated. Thanks to 父亲, some follow our family, while others dream of ripping out our throats, in his words.\nWhat is dignity, Master 布拉克?
6192355001490252 What we do best: work.
6192355001490256 "We"? You and I have different paths.
6192355001490251 What are we going to do now?
6192355001490254 We'll see about that.
6192355001490257 Everything is always on the Lines. Don't you forget that.
6192355001490253 I <i>will</i> try to achieve what I wanted. Revive and reform the Bull Enterprise. Now that there's nothing more to lose—and nothing is on the line—I can be more daring.
6192354999936854 小维拉德
6192355001258457 小维拉德 
6192354999936855 卡佩拉
6192354999870405 不到。我离开了五年而已。
6192354999870406 七年？也许。你总是很擅长和数字打交道。
6192354999870407 你变了，劳拉。你长大了。你的眼神如此冷酷。
6192354999870404 …多久了？七年？
6192354999870409 你为什么用那样的眼神看着我？
6192354999870408 感觉像十年。
6192354999870411 你为什么用那样的眼神看着我？
6192354999870410 你知道我心脏有毛病，这里的空气很浑浊。
6192354999870413 啊，那...没事。
6192354999870414 每个人都这样。相信我，我是外科医生。
6192354999870412 你问起来有股血腥味。
6192354999870416 你在说什么？
6192354999870415 现在，我们分担着同样的痛苦。难姐难弟。这就是你来见我的原因。对吗？
6192354999870422 我很抱歉。我不是很了解你的父亲...但是我一直很尊敬他。他一定是战斗中阵亡的，对吗？
6192354999870423 今天早晨...劳拉，你在说什么？ 
6192354999870424 是的，他被杀了。你知道有关的任何事情吗？
6192354999870421 我们都很爱我们的父亲。但是，现在他们都走了。你的父亲，今天早晨被杀了。我的父亲，则是去年春天，在Fords战役之后。 很多可怕的事情发生了...在你离开这段时间。
6192354999870426 请说。
6192354999870425 哦。你不知道...
6192354999870428 父亲给我送了封信...两周前。一封令人不安的信，写道他卷入了一场危险之中。 
6192354999870429 我想我会弄清楚的。 你会帮助我吗，劳拉？我们还是朋友？ 
6192354999870430 我想现在我知道为什么了。来接替父亲的位置
6192354999870427 当我没说。我现在不想提这些。你为什么回来。
6192354999870432 你不会怀疑是我干的吧？
6192354999870431 他黎明时分被谋杀的，就在你的家里。没人知道凶手是谁。\n普通群众归咎于刹那——草原怪物。其他人声称是某个女人杀死了他。还有一些人，发誓是外乡人所为，一个浑身沾满血的大汉...就像你一样。
6192354999870434 我会找到凶手的，当然。
6192354999870435 我不知道。
6192354999870436 我需要公正。我会向当局投降，解释一切...现在谁管事？
6192354999870433 你现在要做什么？
6192354999870438 好的。我现在快站不住脚了...
6192354999870439 我打了一架，劳拉。这就是我摇摆不定的原因…
6192354999870440 谢谢你。我不介意吃一两口。
6192354999870437 知道吗？你哪都不能去——我不允许。看看你自己。 你几乎站不住了，更别说四处追逐刺客了。\n你 留下来了。吃点东西，然后睡觉。当你醒来时，我们会弄清剩下的事。怎么样？
6192354999870479 我应该睡楼上吗？客房以前在那儿，无论如何...当我们还是孩子的时候。
6192354999870480 你甚至不给我安排一张桌子？没有面包，没有盐？没有热情款待…
6192354999870478 你需要什么就拿什么。大厅的柜子里一定有什么东西。
6192354999870491 …劳拉, 怎么回事？你为什么不看着我？
6192354999870492 随意。如果你不高兴见到我，直接说不好了。
6192354999870490 不，别上楼。楼上锁了。\n自父亲去世，我就再也没上去过。而是谁这张床。
6192354999870494 …劳拉，怎么回事？你为什么不看着我？
6192354999870495 你知道，我想我该走了。时间很宝贵。
6192354999870493 …你知道东西在哪。我的家就是你的家。让自己舒服点。
6192354999870497 我懂，我懂...
6192354999870498 不要提我父亲。求求你，现在不要。 
6192354999870496 不要，现在不要。去吃东西吧！你知道现在是九月，不是吗？你还记得这里的秋天是什么样子吗？\n 你必须吃，即使只吃一点，否则你会变得虚弱。你父亲教我们的！
6192354999870500 你说得对。我有一阵子没睡了。尽管我在旅途中打了个盹。
6192354999870501 别喊了。我比你更了解大草原和蓷薾，好吗？
6192354999870499 必须要我提醒你，你需要比平时更多的睡眠吗？\n现在是九月！大草原变凉了，蓷薾开花了。你忘了吗？你上次睡觉是什么时候？
6192354999870503 的确… 我应该吃点东西。睡会觉。就按这个顺序来。
6192354999870504 我无所畏惧。
6192354999870505 谢谢你, 劳拉… 尽管如此，我还是感觉有些不对。
6192354999870502 你不能抽出一个小时或五个小时吗？是的，时间是宝贵的。那又怎么样！\n 最坏的情况已经过去了。你担心情况还会恶化吗？他们不会。你父亲的凶手不会逃跑……至少在下一班火车之前。
6192354999870507 似乎是这样，
6192354999870508 不是我，不。
6192354999870506 你没有别的地方可去了。你就是那个亡命之徒在追捕的人，是吗？
6192354999870510 听起来棒极了。 谢谢你，劳拉.
6192354999870511 可能找错了？你也相信？我从来没有料到你和所有人一样。
6192354999870512 小心点。外面的人疯得很，
6192354999870509 当你睡着的时候，我去散步，刺探一下情况。也许我会了解一些东西，或者更好的是，让他们知道他们可能找错了人。
6192354999870514 You don't have much to steal.
6192354999870515 "Cub"? So, 格拉薇尔… You've remembered our old friendship.
6192354999870516 Ugh, what a dream I had. Twyre is indeed in full bloom.
6192354999870513 …Wake up, Cub! There's someone upstairs! A thief must have gotten in. Or someone even worse…?
6192354999870518 Don't be silly. Even I don't believe those tales—it's unbecoming of you, all right?
6192354999870520 Well, I hope so. Is there a weapon I can borrow?
6192354999870519 I'll look around. Just stay calm.
6192354999870517 Something's fumbling around, I hear it. What if it's… the thing? The thing that killed 伊西多?\nWhat if the soil spit out a shabnak after all?
6192354999870522 Forget it. I'll get by on strength, if needed.
6192354999870523 It'll have to do.
6192354999870521 Of course not. Maybe a knife in the kitchen, I guess.
6192354999870525 He was just trying to scare us.
6192354999870526 Drink some water and calm down. Even if a shabnak did come into town, it wouldn't climb up a building.
6192354999870524 You're the one acting silly! You've forgotten everything. Don't you remember those bones we found strung together? 伊西多 himself told us those were shabnak remains.
6192354999870528 I'll check in a minute. I need to collect my thoughts… Still troubled by the dream I had…
6192354999870529 Wait a minute. I need to think.
6192354999870527 Well?
6192354999870531 What'd you do?
6192354999870532 What looks bad?
6192354999870533 It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to be Cub again. I missed you, 劳拉.
6192354999870530 Things still look bad for you, Cub… but I managed to help a little.
6192354999870535 Ah, sweet home. Clarity of mind, sound logic—that's why I love my fellow countrymen.
6192354999870536 What? People think I killed my own 父亲?
6192354999870537 But I only arrived at dawn! Got stabbed at once. I didn't even make it off the train!
6192354999870534 People's brains have turned to mush. Some insist you killed 西蒙. Others, that… you killed 伊西多.\nThe rest believe it was a shabnak who stole your shape, so they punish random women, any women they find.
6192354999870539 "Steppe, endless steppe, the way lies far before us…"
6192354999870540 All right. What must I do, then?
6192354999870538 They don't care. They don't think, Cub! Blame September. They're all steppe-headed. Twyre-ridden.
6192354999870542 They'll come to their senses. But I'll forever be suspected of patricide.
6192354999870543 Thank you, 劳拉. I'll never forget this. Now I just need to find 斯塔克…
6192354999870541 They'll come to their senses soon. You know how mobs work. I explained, to the right folks, you had nothing to do with 伊西多's death. Women, mostly. They'll spread the news quick. Here in the Flank, at least. In the Chine, in Backbone… you'll be safer.
6192354999870545 Is it?
6192354999870546 As usual…
6192354999870544 That's up to you, Cub.
6192354999870548 Five years, not six. Closer this time, though.
6192354999870550 It was kill or be killed. You'd rather see me dead?
6192354999870549 Butchers aren't monsters. They're workers.
6192354999870547 You were gone for… six years? You're an outsider now, and you came back on the wrong side. Maybe you didn't kill 伊西多, but you killed someone, right?\nI didn't even need to see the blood. Your butcher's eyes told me everything… That thousand-yard stare.
6192354999870552 How come?
6192354999870553 I'm not fragile. I'll manage.
6192354999870551 Go ahead. But don't act surprised if you're unwelcome.
6192354999870555 I've done nothing wrong.
6192354999870556 Do you also think I'm a monster?
6192354999870554 His dedication to 伊西多… Few sons are as loyal to their 父亲s. He's grown cold toward you, the one who abandoned his mentor.\nPerhaps he thought he could replace you as 伊西多's heir. Now… I bet he'll lose his mind. All in all, don't expect kindness from him.
6192354999870558 I know.
6192354999870559 Thank you, G拉薇尔. For everything.
6192354999870560 That's how you see me? "Your steppe people" and "us"? I shouldn't have come back at all.
6192354999870557 You'll have to start over, Cub. Although… maybe not entirely. The Kin must be eager to see you.\nWith 伊西多 gone, someone has to take his place. Not just for your steppe people, but for us all.
6192354999870578 Some… beggar, I think, broke into your house. She's babbling nonsense. Should I toss her out?
6192354999870577 Nothing. You must have imagined it.
6192354999870579 Well, she's not a shabnak. Don't worry. She'll leave soon.
6192354999870576 So what was it?
6192354999870581 You have a guest.
6192354999870582 Who's the girl upstairs?
6192354999870583 Just felt nostalgic, is all.
6192354999870580 Why did you go upstairs? I told you, there's nothing to see there.
6192354999870585 You're right. I need sleep.
6192354999870586 Some creepy brat's up there, just grinning! Said a bunch of nasty things to me.
6192354999870584 No one's there! Everything's locked up. Get some sleep this instant. Your hallucinations scare me.
6192354999870588 Fine. I'm not one to pry into the secrets of others.
6192354999870589 Autumn air, twyre in bloom… Understood. Goodnight.
6192354999870587 布拉克, to bed! Now! You're seeing nonexistent girls! Give it half an hour, and you'll imagine even scarier monsters. Have some pity on my nerves! Go to bed!
6192354999870591 She's not so gentle. More likely, you'll need that care.
6192354999870592 She could use that.
6192354999870590 Don't. If she's already here, let her be. Maybe she's hiding from the violent mob. I'll check on her later, provide some care, if needed.
6192354999870594 But still right, huh?
6192354999870595 What got into him?
6192354999870593 So, here we are again… I managed to calm down 斯塔克. He was wrong about you. Or… he was not entirely right, at least.
6192354999870597 Why would I refuse?
6192354999870598 You're too late. I've already accepted what I must do.
6192354999870599 …Inheritance?
6192354999870596 Were you already offered your 父亲's inheritance, Cub? Refuse it, I beg you! Do not follow his path.
6192354999870601 Explain yourself.
6192354999870602 My 父亲? Cruel?
6192354999870600 I don't know if I can properly explain this… There is no happiness down this path, not for yourself or others. Your 父亲's path was cruel, Cub.
6192354999870604 I'm sure he had his reasons.
6192354999870605 You're being awfully poetic about this.
6192354999870606 What exactly did he want to change?
6192354999870603 All in all, this is a quiet town. Not perfect, but there's a place for everyone. We're all connected through bonds of love, of friendship, of patience.\nLife flows through those bonds, the Town's veins, and to cut them would cause harm. Your 父亲… don't be mad… he dreamed of remaking it all.
6192354999870608 Perhaps he thought that for a reason.
6192354999870609 I'm not too fond of our town, either, after that welcome I received.
6192354999870607 Everything. Our town felt wrong to him.\nHe used to say that broken bones set badly will cripple a man, leaving him unable to function as others do. To 伊西多, our town was a vile malunion.
6192354999870611 What do you mean?
6192354999870610 He <i>was</i> a healer, sure. He knew life as no one else could. The Kin revered him. But even that did us more harm than good, in the end.
6192354999870613 It was the right decision.
6192354999870614 That's terrible, but I'd make the same call in his shoes.
6192354999870615 Impossible!
6192354999870612 Five years ago, there was an outbreak in the Crude Sprawl. It spread like wildfire—dozens and dozens dead. People sent for 伊西多.\nWhen he arrived, he… he ordered the whole quarter to be quarantined. No one could leave, not even the healthy people trapped inside.
6192354999870617 But the Town lived on.
6192354999870616 The townsfolk obeyed his orders without question. They barricaded the whole neighborhood. In the end, there were almost no survivors.
6192354999870619 There's no rest for the wicked.
6192354999870620 Peace only lasts until the next war.
6192354999870621 I see what you mean, dear G拉薇尔. I will think about it.
6192354999870618 I suppose that is true. But Cub… do not take his inheritance. 伊西多's inheritance is his power, his authority, his duties. If you become another 伊西多, we will never rest, we will never know peace.
6192354999870623 What's so bad about following in my 父亲's footsteps?
6192354999870622 As 斯塔克 would explain this, 伊西多's inheritance involves more than material possessions—it's a legacy. Accepting his legacy would mean taking his place among the Kin. They expect that of you.
6192354999870625 What do you mean?
6192354999870626 一个外科医生难免会见点血。
6192354999870624 He was a kind man, but his deeds were… ruthless.
6192354999870628 I want to talk to you first. He can wait.
6192354999870629 I already did. If you ask me, the man's losing his marbles.
6192354999870627 You should let him speak for himself.
6192355001525154 Yeah… I fell asleep here. I'm exhausted…
6192355001525155 How did you find me? Did you wait long?
6192355001525153 我们是来见你的...住手，斯塔克!
6192355000219972 At times like these, reasonable folks stay at home. You should too, 劳拉.
6192355000219973 I'm sure there's something you can do.
6192355000219975 Well, 斯塔克's desperate for us to keep busy. Who else could provide cold compresses to the sick?
6192355000219971 I've come… I've come to help. There must be something I can do, right?
6192355000219977 Me? It's a tough one, I suppose. I'm going to make a cure for the sand pest.
6192355000219976 …Okay. I'll find a way to help on my own. And you? What are you up to?
6192355000219981 Are you familiar with how blood serums work?
6192355000219982 Hey, Pasteur and Koch worked in barns. Never stopped them.
6192355000219980 A cure? In these conditions? Don't you need… I don't know, special instruments? An army of chemists? The best we have is a kitchen stove.\nHow do you hope to succeed?
6192355000219984 We take blood rich with antibodies, purify it, and inject the patient with the resulting serum.
6192355000219985 We can enhance the antibodies of someone already ill with certain herbs—for example, twyre.
6192355000219986 It won't be perfect. Side effects are almost guaranteed, but it should save the patient. All we need to do is find the right donor.
6192355000219983 No, I don't. Wait… No, I definitely don't.
6192355000219988 I'll find someone. The blood of sick townsfolk will be a good start.
6192355000219989 I never said it was a person. Such a serum could be made from animals.
6192355000219990 Sick people have antibodies. Maybe only a little, and in certain areas of the body, but they can be found.
6192355000219987 And where will you find a suitable donor? Sand pest kills anyone, everyone, and it kills quick. Not a soul survived the outbreak five years past.
6192355000219992 我可不做任何保证。
6192355000219993 我保证。
6192355000219994 谢谢你，劳拉。你是唯一信任我的人。 
6192355000219991 This hunt for blood sounds dangerous, Cub. Won't you just infect yourself? Promise me you'll be as careful as you can. If you need me, please ask.
6192355001158253 Sure. In an hour or so.
6192355001158254 If you promise to feed me.
6192355001158255 Well… If I have the time. Which is to say, I doubt it.
6192355001158251 你今天能抽空过来一趟吗？
6192355001181252 我可不做任何保证。
6192355001181253 我保证。
6192355001181254 谢谢你，劳拉。你是唯一信任我的人。
6192355001181251 This hunt for blood sounds dangerous, Cub. Won't you just infect yourself? Promise me you'll be as careful as you can. If you need me, please ask.
6192355000717268 Why would I worry…?
6192355000717269 奥吉姆斯基...我想知道他怎么知道我在那的...
6192355000717270 To hell with it. I don't want to see anyone. Except you, of course.
6192355000717267 Someone's here. From 奥吉姆斯基. They want to talk to you. Don't worry—there's no danger.
6192355000745269 I guess.
6192355001425053 You've lived too soberly as it is.
6192355001425060 What experience?
6192355000745268 That was a sobering experience. Don't you think so?
6192355001425055 This too will pass. Believe me, 劳拉.
6192355001425067 No, it hasn't. We need to rebuild. Make it as it was before, but better.
6192355001425068 Consider it a vaccination. They always hurt, always make you feverish.
6192355001425054 I don't want to live anymore, Cub. I just… don't. Life has lost meaning.
6192355001425057 You've never been overly sentimental, that's for sure.
6192355001425058 No, I'm sorry. That was stupid of me to say.
6192355001425059 Of course you have. You're clear-headed. Determined.
6192355001425056 Have I?
6192355001425062 Don't worry. Things will return to normal, eventually…
6192355001425063 What did you expect? People are people.
6192355001425064 Sobering… It should be sobering. Those are the people you wanted to serve. That's what they're like! I mean, what <i>we're</i> like.
6192355001425061 The outbreak. All eleven days of it.
6192355001425066 Even so, it's better then death. Even if it's more… exhausting.
6192355001425065 No. It will not. It's all gone now.
6192355001425070 I don't know… The past, I guess?
6192355001425071 The earth. So we can keep our feet planted.
6192355001425072 Whatever it was, we needed it to have the right to try something new.
6192355001425069 But what were we vaccinated against, Cub?
6192355001425074 Hey, don't lose heart, sister! Come on, cheer up. Never say that again.
6192355001425075 That's not true. I need you.
6192355001425076 It will pass… Believe me. Come here, come here. Let me hug you.
6192355001425073 You know what else I've realized? No one needs me here. I'm useless. Whatever I do, it only makes things worse. It's either stupid, or ridiculous, or fruitless… No one needs me.
6192355001425078 There. Much better.
6192355001425079 I… I can't raise my hands! Hey! What sort of trickery is this?
6192355001425077 Thanks. I could use a hug.
6192355001425081 It's like… like something won't let me!
6192355001425082 I… I remember now. He said I wouldn't be able to hug anyone. Damn it…
6192355001425080 What's wrong? You don't have to hug me if you don't want to…
6192355000771962 Well, here I am.
6192355001430972 If you need me, why didn't you call?
6192355000771961 Oh. I was just wondering if you'd come.
6192355001430974 Huh. Is it really you? Never heard you utter that word.
6192355001430977 I prefer to keep things simple.
6192355001430973 It felt more exciting to wonder.
6192355001430976 Well, I didn't <i>adopt</i> them. They just kinda… crawled into my life.
6192355001430978 I did.
6192355001430979 Where'd you hear that? Why would I want kids?
6192355001651771 They're dead. I don't want to talk about it.
6192355001430975 I heard you adopted some kids? Orphans?
6192355001430981 Do you count your every word?
6192355001430982 Once a year while I was away, I bet. "I wonder where that idiot is…"
6192355001430980 Well, I've said it before. Maybe five times or so.
6192355001430984 I'll figure it out.
6192355001430985 It's not complicated. You feed them and wipe their noses. They handle the rest.
6192355001430986 I think these kids have already raised themselves.
6192355001430983 How will you raise them? Some 父亲 you are…
6192355001430988 As in…?
6192355001430993 No.
6192355001430987 Want my help?
6192355001430990 I do. And I agree.
6192355001430991 No. Those are my cubs.
6192355001430992 That's unexpected, coming from you. I'll think about it.
6192355001430989 As in <i>just</i> help, you idiot! I just want to be useful. Make it easier for you and maybe lighten my own life a bit. You know…
6192355000934563 …劳拉?
6192355000934576 I will be good, I promise…
6192355000934562 Children! 阿泰米 fell asleep. Though he has dis格蕾丝d this class, we must continue.\nToday, I'll teach you the right way to eat a person. For a woman, start with the softest flesh. For a man, the internal organs. And please, stay away from anyone with red hair. Their flesh is venomous.
6192355000934565 Stop!
6192355000934572 Life's rules are simple… Oh, I forgot how it went.
6192355000934573 I've got a question.
6192355000934564 Children! Life's rules are simple. \nEveryone for themselves. Everyone's shirt is closer to their skin. It's neither your headache nor your piece of cake. Homō hominī lupus est. You have neither mothers nor 父亲s. Murder unseen. Repeat after me.
6192355000934567 I wasn't asleep.
6192355000934568 格拉薇尔？你发什么疯呢？
6192355000934569 Let's skip straight to the cane…
6192355000934566 You've fallen asleep! This is the most important lesson of your life, and you've fallen asleep! The most crucial lesson!\nChildren! What do we say to 阿泰米? How will we punish him? Will he stand in the corner, like 丹尼尔?
6192355000934575 Why is 丹尼尔 being punished?
6192355000934577 This is all a joke, 劳拉… Isn't it?
6192355000934574 Ask questions with your hand raised! If you have any hands left, I mean.
6192355000934579 Poverty.
6192355000934580 Glory, I guess…
6192355000934581 Oblivion?
6192355000934578 丹尼尔 was punished for insolence. Children! Which of you can tell us why 丹尼尔 deserves punishment? Children! Tell us, what awaits him?
6192355000934583 Pinch me, someone…
6192355000934584 That's true, but…
6192355000954451 丹尼尔's mumbling from his corner… I think he just said those are Berkeley's ideas.
6192355000934582 Children! To survive, to remain resolute, you must heed this lesson. Remember: History is written by winners. There is no truth. The truth is whatever you think it is.
6192355000934586 我做了作业，我发誓！
6192355000934587 I'm going to give you a sleeping pill. You need to sleep, G拉薇尔.
6192355000934588 Divination. 劳拉, you are about to kill a person. You'll be executed for it.
6192355000934585 If you have a friend, learn to betray them. If you have a lover, disappoint them first, then betray them and leave them behind.\nChildren! I'm teaching you how to survive. What was your homework?
6192355000954453 No.
6192355000954458 Well… I can guess. I've been around the Town, after all.
6192355000954452 Cub, I'm in trouble. Have you heard about the water?
6192355000954461 Sabotaged the water pumps? 为什么？
6192355000954462 Idiots. It's not cholera.
6192355001257897 I understand, yes. Without fresh water, we're all doomed.
6192355000954460 We're running out of water. They won't carry in more from the steppe springs because of the quarantine.\nAnd, last night, someone sabotaged the water pumps. The remaining barrels are all we have. Do you understand?
6192355000954464 More nonsense. The cemetery isn't far, and it's spacious. We have plenty of room for the dead. For now, anyway.
6192355000954465 This… this is the real epidemic. It infects people's minds.
6192355000954463 Because the屠宰场 dumps its waste into the Gorkhon. But the pumps take water from the Gullet and the Guzzle. They're more clear.\nBut today, a rumor spread that the pumps were producing muddy water, because someone allegedly dumped corpses into the tributaries.
6192355000954468 Well, it makes sense. Why would you need more?
6192355001257898 There's a water pump next to your house. Want me to fix it?
6192355001257918 Actually, I fixed the water pump next to your house. You're all set.
6192355000954467 Things are bad, Cub. God knows when the water bearers will return to the steppe. Those barrels are all we have, and they'll be guarded. Each person is only allowed one bottle.
6192355000954470 A stupid idea! If you invite random people, you're bound to get infected!
6192355000954471 A home for the living… You're still searching for a way to serve, aren't you? 劳拉, I don't think you have it in you.
6192355000954472 I've always respected you, G拉薇尔. And my respect just grew.
6192355000954469 Listen. I want to provide a place for the healthy people who have lost their homes. A home for the living. My house is on the outskirts, so the plague wouldn't reach us here.\nBut this isn't feasible without drinking water.
6192355000954474 我想他会的，是的。
6192355000954475 我有种不详的预感。
6192355001261751 没门。忘了吧。
6192355000954473 父亲会赞成的。
6192355000954477 Well… I'll see what I can do, but I'm not sure.
6192355000954478 Oh, don't give me that martyred look! …Fine. I'll do it.
6192355000954479 It won't work, 劳拉.
6192355000954476 In the Middle Town, it's 奥吉姆斯基's people who will guard the water… Just tell them. They'll listen.\nPlease, sweet Cub, I beg of you! It's not selfish. It's for a good cause, those poor survivors… No one else cares for the homeless… Please?
6192355001257900 How much is "lots"?
6192355001257899 I need drinking water. Lots of it. Pumps really aren't a good source, Cub… Whatever they say, now is not the time to take risks.
6192355001257917 为什么？
6192355001257916 No. I mean… Yes, it would be nice of you, but that's not what I need.
6192355001257920 为什么？
6192355001257921 Oh. I thought you'd appreciate it.
6192355001257919 Oh, but listen! Thank you, Cub, that was very thoughtful, but… it's not enough.
6192355001257923 So I'll, what, drag it here? I'm not a draft horse.
6192355001257924 But you said yourself they're guarded. No one would just give me one.
6192355001257922 I'll need water. Plenty of water. Get me a barrel, Cub, please! Have it delivered here. You're a doctor. You have special authority.
6192355000954455 劳拉!这水不能喝！ 
6192355001169728 There's been a rumor that someone infected the barrels…
6192355000954454 Thank you. Many people have already used the barrel. I told them it was all thanks to you.
6192355000954486 我做了些什么...
6192355000954487 你做了些什么...
6192355000954488 我们做些了什么...
6192355000954485 What? 为什么？ The water's muddy, sure, but it's good. Everyone drank it, and no one got sick. I did, too, and look at me: I'm fine!
6192355000954490 Let us hope for the best…
6192355000954491 不要再喝那个桶里的水了。它不安全。
6192355000954489 What's wrong? Don't let the paranoia get to you. You've done well.
6192355001257902 But what if it's true?
6192355001257925 我还是那句话，不要再喝那个桶里的水了。好吗？
6192355001257901 Oh, nonsense! I don't believe in imaginary poisoners!
6192355001257906 这很危险...
6192355001257926 Who started it?
6192355001257905 I know perfectly well who started this silly rumor! It's just muddy water. And I need it desperately, Cub! For the people!
6192355001257910 劳拉!
6192355001257934 Whatever. Do as you want…
6192355001257909 Oh, it's not so bad! Unlike dying of thirst.
6192355001257912 What is?
6192355001257935 Death favors the bold… Fear is a natural shield.
6192355001257911 What next? Shall we become terrified of one another? Too anxious to eat bread? We can't succumb to fear, Cub! The disease isn't the worst part of an outbreak.
6192355001257936 Fine. Share this water with your guests. But you, yourself, will drink only what is distributed in bottles. Got it?
6192355001257932 I never could beat you in an argument.
6192355001257913 The way people transform! Don't let fear overtake you! Fear is the worst disease. It weakens your spirit and welcomes illness!
6192355001257928 Shabnak-adyg.
6192355001257931 劳拉，我需要你活下去！
6192355001257927 The idiots who hunt for the bone-legged carrier! Or was she clay-legged? What's her name…
6192355001257930 劳拉! 风险太大了！ Think straight!
6192355001257933 It's dangerous!
6192355001257929 Yes, exactly. A shabnak-adyg. Do you seriously want me to deny people water because of a fairy tale?
6192355001049652 Well… I missed you.
6192355001049655 Unhappy to see me again?
6192355001049651 Speak of the devil! You've started to like coming here, haven't you? Are you sure your boots won't wear down?
6192355001049657 …What's wrong with you, basaghan? Woke up on the wrong side of the bed?
6192355001049667 That's fine. I can do without your help. And I can leave, if you don't want me here.
6192355001049656 Aren't you supposed to be terribly busy? I don't understand why you keep coming.\nOr do you need my help again? I'll wash your clothes. You're filthy, like a chimney sweep. Revolting. While they dry, have some sleep.
6192355001049659 They're not my steppe girls. They belong to the Kin.
6192355001049660 Fine! What's wrong with you, ekhene?
6192355001049661 All right. Abgay, what got into you today?
6192355001049658 I hate it when you call me that! Is it so hard to remember? "Basaghan" your steppe girls, not me!
6192355001049663 It's like "the elder sister." Would you prefer that?
6192355001049664 "My sweet." "My dear."
6192355001100651 It roughly translates as "the most reasonable and friendly."
6192355001049662 And what does <i>that</i> word mean?
6192355001049666 Whoa… I'm liking it less and less all of a sudden.
6192355001049668 I promised her nothing. I don't even remember her. She just keeps… tagging along, asking stupid questions.
6192355001049669 Why in the world should you care?
6192355001049665 Yeah…?\nOne of yours came to me today. Asked a lot of questions. Said she was promised you… Said a lot of things… Did you ever promise to marry her?
6192355001049671 Doesn't look like it…
6192355001100652 Forget 斯塔克. I see now that I'm one step away from falling out with <i>you.</i> 为什么？
6192355001049670 Ugh, whatever. Like it's any of my business… Do whatever you want.\nDid you make peace with 斯塔克?
6192355001100654 But what does it have to do with me?
6192355001100653 I'm sorry. Forget it.\nIt's just that sometimes you feel, all too poignantly, that your life is over. You're not even thirty, but you're done. Not dead, but burnt through… and there's nothing ahead for you.
6192355001100661 …Perhaps the four of us should meet today? Even 坏格里夫? Like the good old days.
6192355001100656 Yes. It could have.
6192355001100664 …All I wanted was to see if you were okay. See you, 劳拉.
6192355001100655 Nothing. Not now, anyway. It's just… it could have gone differently.
6192355001100658 That's some strategic thinking. Measuring life in years.
6192355001100657 That's all right. It won't take you two even a year to reconcile. Like you have a choice…
6192355001100660 What's wrong with you, 劳拉?
6192355001100659 A year more, a year less… I may even live to be a hundred years old. So what?
6192355001100663 Precisely. The Apple Road, by the Basket.
6192355001100665 Yes. The night will be clear.
6192355001100666 I mean, it's better than your place… It's too gloomy here.
6192355001100662 Then again… Indeed… You're right. Let's do it. The four of us. 格里夫 included. Today. The old place—the Apple Road, right? By midnight, as usual?
6192355001100668 Let's gather together, huh? The four of us? I mean it. I'll arrange everything.
6192355001100667 格里夫? You've no idea what quagmire 格里夫 has gotten himself in… And 斯塔克? He's also done something awful… The Judge is angry at him. He summoned him to the Crucible for questioning! He's still here—what does that even mean, huh?\nOh, the three of you deserve each other!
6192355001173179 That's not how I imagined our meeting to go, basaghan…
6192355001173178 I don't know… No. I'm not.
6192355001173181 Aren't you happy to see me, 劳拉?
6192355001173180 What are you waiting for? Take what you need and go. You can sleep upstairs if you're tired.
6192355001049654 What did you talk about?
6192355001103301 About what is in store for us all?
6192355001049653 We've been talking, while we were waiting for you.
6192355001103291 We did. Isn't that enough?
6192355001103292 I expected as much. The gatherings of old friends seem inappropriate now…
6192355001103290 No one came.
6192355001103294 Tragedies like this bring people together. Ought to, anyway. So it did to us…
6192355001103295 I feel like this plague will become a great weaver, mending that which was broken.
6192355001103293 Isn't it obvious? Any old grudges pale in comparison to this sort of catastrophe.
6192355001103297 You don't have to.
6192355001103298 If not for the plague, no one would change their mind.
6192355001103296 I disagree. The outbreak will sow discord. It will tear apart friends, families…\nIt wasn't the plague that got us together. It was you.
6192355001103300 Come on… You were always the thread that held us together.
6192355001103304 The last hug before the flood comes?
6192355001103299 No. It was all you. Your will.\nYou've done really well, Cub. You swallowed your pride and the wrongs done to you… You weren't ashamed to vouch for 格里夫. I don't think I could've done the same.
6192355001103303 Well, that's good to hear. I hoped you would. Did the three of you make peace?
6192355001103302 No. About each other.
6192355001103306 Of course.
6192355001103318 We'll try. By the way… do you know why all the Stations were shut down? Both the Cargo and the Passenger Stations. Has it been long?
6192355001103305 We'll protect each other. And we'll try to survive. Yes?
6192355001103308 Why "sand"?
6192355001103311 I know nothing, except that there was an outbreak before.
6192355001103307 What do you know of this disease? They're calling it "sand pest." You know 为什么？
6192355001103310 Nonsense.
6192355001103309 Because it makes your skin dry like sand. People still believe it came from below the ground. All those fairy tales of an earthen golem, a clay-legged shabnak… You know…
6192355001103313 Three scribbled pages, some drawings on the walls… No. Nothing.
6192355001103312 What about your 父亲? Has he maybe left any notes…?
6192355001103315 Perhaps there isn't. So what? The most important things inside us need not rely on hope.
6192355001103324 Hope is the only thing that stands between us and ending it all every evening.
6192355001103325 I prefer not to think about it. I need to concentrate on my work. What is to come, will come.
6192355001103314 It mowed down everyone in that poor district last time. No survivors. Every single person got infected, every single person died. Does this mean there's no hope?
6192355001103317 It's good that you still have the sense of humor.
6192355001103323 <i>Of course</i> I mean the organs. Like there's anything else I could be talking about…
6192355001103316 I hope you don't mean the internal organs.
6192355001103320 Served as a medic for a while. Nothing interesting.
6192355001103321 No, of course I wasn't. I'd make a terrible 士兵…
6192355001103319 The Passenger Station was shut down a year ago. Cargo, only recently. In the summer. \nThere was some sort of a renewal project… Remember how enthusiastic they were about building new railroads before the war? …Were you also there, on the front?
6192355001523978 …Something's wrong with me. I can't raise my arms for some reason! What's going on?
6192355001523977 Of course…
6192355001523981 I'm sorry…
6192355001523982 That's because I… in the Theatre… ah, forget it.
6192355001523980 …What it is?
6192355001257889 There was a water pump by your house. I fixed it. You have water now.
6192355001257890 I haven't had a minute of rest. I suppose the running around warms me.
6192355001257888 It's growing colder. Have you noticed?
6192355001257892 It's from the tributaries—the Gullet and the Guzzle. The water there is less polluted, because it comes from the steppe.
6192355001257893 It does <i>not.</i> It's normal water.
6192355001257891 Cub, that water's only good for washing floors. It's from the river. It reeks of the屠宰场!
6192355001257895 Fine. You'll have your barrel.
6192355001257896 Oh, I'll definitely go there at some point.
6192355001257894 Those fools destroyed the pumps on impulse, of course. But where else could the disease have come from, if not the屠宰场? Think about it.\nHonestly, I'm surprised you and 丹考夫斯基 haven't turned that place upside down already! Even that girl, 克拉拉, mentioned the屠宰场…
6192355001257938 It didn't work out. I'm sorry, 格拉薇尔.
6192355001257939 You won't receive a clean barrel. Everyone is equal when it comes to the threat of thirst, homeless or not.
6192355001257937 So?
6192355001257941 Yes. Bringing you one of those obviously would have been a disservice.
6192355001257942 No. Just a slip of the tongue. Forget it.
6192355001257940 …Are you implying there were unclean barrels, too?
6192355001257944 丹考夫斯基 determined it was.
6192355001257945 似乎是这样。
6192355001257946 则意味着某人在 <i>故意</i>传播疾病。 请小心你的计划，格拉薇尔。不要让陌生人进来，任何。
6192355001257943 这不可能...
6192355001426152 你还活着...
6192355001426174 你这个傻瓜...小傻瓜！...你都留好遗言了？
6192355001426175 你做了什么...
6192355001426151 他不在这里。
6192355001426180 但是你本想亲自动手，对吗？我敢打赌你准备开枪打点什么，确保他知道自己因何而死，没错吧？ 
6192355001426176 他们已经解决了他。没有我。
6192355001426179 你应该感谢老天你失败了！
6192355001426181 你被捕了吗？
6192355001426182 你在这做了什么？左轮枪？把它给我。小心点。
6192355001426178 我失败了。失败了...
6192355001426184 为什么？
6192355001426187 来吧。我们离开这里。好吗？结束了，请...跟我来。
6192355001426183 我没能做任何事。我进来后，在这等着。他们问我想干什么，我说我想见将军。然后他们就笑了...说我可有的等了。
6192355001426186 他们为什么没把你轰出去？
6192355001426209 你父亲究竟发生了什么？这就是我来时你不愿告诉我的那个故事？ 
6192355001426185 是的。
6192355001426189 我全了解了...
6192355001426193 总算把他们打发了。现在我们走吧...
6192355001426188 发生了哗变。叛乱。我无意听到了。\n只不过，这不是真的...他们告诉士兵将军得了瘟疫，所以他们准备撤离。但是他没有生病，他们逮捕了他。为了离开小镇，你明白了吗？
6192355001426191 你怎么会这么想？
6192355001426192 是吗？就我的角度看起来他们仍是。
6192355001426190 他们不会在乎的。他们已经不再是军人了。 
6192355001426195 What?
6192355001426196 我们真的需要离开这里。现在，好吗？
6192355001426194 Only, here's what I think. Longin, the mutineers' leader, was Block's executive 士官. 他忠实的走狗。 父亲写道他为将军赴汤蹈火。意味着...
6192355001426198 停止大吼大叫！他们会听到的...安静！ 
6192355001426199 那就让他们这么做吧。让他们不用开炮就离开。但是格拉薇尔, dear, please… sweet 格拉薇尔. 我们走吧，你不应该在这...
6192355001426197 It's not a mutiny. 他们抓住他，确保他不用违抗命令。\n他们敬仰他， General Ashes. A beloved general. They removed him from dirty work to make sure he has an excuse. That he's safe! 这样他们回去时他就不会受到惩罚！
6192355001426201 He'll meet his fate sooner or later. Come on, that's enough war for you for today.
6192355001426202 No one will escape this meat grinder whole, Block least likely of all. Neither will you if you keep standing here. How much time do you think they need to notice what you're hiding under your shirt?
6192355001426200 And that means he'll escape with his whole hide! Safe, with a clean reputation!
6192355001426206 To the contrary. Such events follow a particular… line, so to speak.
6192355001426208 Still, hand me that pop gun of yours. And no "buts."
6192355001426205 It's all pointless… All pointless.
6192355001426211 你有把握格拉薇尔叔叔是被布洛克给...？ 
6192355001426210 是的。现在我不想提这事。
6192355001426213 安静！
6192355001426214 How about shooting me now? While you're on fire and everything!
6192355001426212 没错。白纸黑字。我们被送了封信。 军事审判，违抗命令由行刑队执行枪决，\n你还想知道什么？如果父亲真的是无辜的？如果审判只是...? If that was the right thing? Go ahead, don't be shy!
6192355001426216 将军怎么了？
6192355001426215 ...我很抱歉。
6192354999887451 劳拉·拉薇尔
6192355001271556 劳拉·拉薇尔
6192354999870631 你唱错了。是“一对有情的生物”，不是“无情。
6192354999870632 我也不记得了。 看墓人在哪？
6192354999870630 <i>“伤心的小狗躺在地上，\n一只小猫黯然神伤，\n一对无情的生物..."</i>\n...剩下的我不记得了，你呢？
6192354999870634 似乎整个小镇都是孤儿。
6192354999870635 你干这份工作是不是太小了点？
6192354999870633 我就是看墓人。现在，无论如何...你为什么那么看着我？ 我的父亲是看墓人，从前是。他三年前死了。
6192354999870637 你是谁，孩子？
6192354999870638 你为什么如此悲伤？
6192354999870636 我没有唱错。
6192354999870640 ...什么？
6192354999870641 我听说因为他是个外科医生，他切开东西而非连接他们。真是愚昧...
6192354999870639 即使死后，人们无法安息，这是如此残忍。我们因何人的罪孽遭受惩罚？为什么泥土将老布拉克拒之门外?
6192354999870643 我是阿泰米·布拉克，孩子。我来给父亲一个合适的安葬。 
6192354999870644 你可以和死者交谈？
6192354999870642 我是很年轻。但是没有其他人可以和死者交谈，不是吗？ 
6192354999870646 我认为你才是需要安抚的人。
6192354999870645 是的。他们需要安抚。他们躺在大地的摇篮里，但这不能抚平他们的疼痛。
6192354999870648 什么债务？
6192354999870649 “推了上去”？这是个啥意思？
6192354999870647 他们已经试图埋葬他两次。但是大地不肯接纳他...它把尸体推了上去。\n这意味着他在尘世间依然有未竟之事。他有债务没有偿还...他是一个有义务感的人。
6192354999870651 我不敢相信我听到的。这怎么可能？ 
6192354999870652 你疯了吗，孩子？
6192354999870650 他被埋得很深。但是当你的人民按照仪式，带着种子和牛奶返回时，他们看到他的身体又一次躺在空旷的大地上。 \ n大地把他推了出去。父亲说过以前发生过类似的事情，在他们埋葬Urehlin酋长时。但他是一个非常坏的人...不像老布拉克一样！
6192354999870654 好吧。待在这里。没必要跟着我。
6192354999870655 火葬不是犯罪。如果事情就像你说的那样，至少它比这种离谱的事要好！
6192354999870653 我不知道。只是...他的负担过于承重。他没能完成某件重要的事... 因为他的生命被切断了。你的人民说，如果地面不接纳，他们就会像老仪式所要求的那样烧掉他。但这太可怕了！
6192354999870657 冷静点！你太激动了！
6192354999870658 如过既不能焚烧死者，但又不能把他埋了......那么还有什么选择？
6192354999870656 这是犯罪！虽然不应该被焚烧！大地不会毁灭，它只会保存它们！它分解它们，并保存它们用于未来的丰收！\ n这里的大地是活的！如果你烧了他们，他们会怎么说话？他们将如何绽放？他们将如何回归？你知道你在说些<i>什么</ i>吗？ 
6192354999870662 你不相信我？ 我想接过他的重任，甚至立誓......但什么都没发生。他们只是看着我，好像我疯了似的。\n因为我不是大草原的人。我不能完全理解它。 
6192354999870680 你今天真的和我父亲说话了？ 
6192355001063356 你怎么的能和死者对话？
6192354999870681 我听说你能...随便吧。简直荒唐。 
6192354999870679 好吧。抱歉，我这就走。
6192354999870678 你为什么来了？不应该在这里。 
6192354999870689 格蕾丝.。他们是这么称呼你的对吧？看着我。
6192354999870691 有人说你和父亲对过话。
6192354999870690 那就是我所想的。晚安。
6192354999870688 不，我没有...
6192354999870693 他们回应了吗？
6192354999870692 All right, fine… It's true. The dead need to be spoken with. Otherwise they're in too much pain.
6192354999870695 A girl told me it kills you slowly. Is that true?
6192355001063358 你能...让我和父亲说话吗?
6192354999870694 有时候。当他们痛苦时，我也会感受到。
6192354999870697 你能帮助我和我父亲对话吗?
6192354999870698 Does it kill you or does it not?
6192354999870696 克拉拉, right? But… she praised me. Said I'm doing the right thing by consoling the dead. She's a very kind girl, though there are those who hate her, for some reason.
6192354999870701 What did he tell you today?
6192354999870700 Don't. Let's not waste your life on trivialities.
6192354999870702 Please do.
6192354999870699 我不知道... I'd need to ask him. I've never done that before.
6192354999870704 I see. I'll leave you be, then.
6192354999870705 我的父亲对你说了些什么？
6192354999870706 Three or four? Okay. We'll have to strategize about how best to use your ability, then.
6192354999870703 它会伤害我。克拉拉说我只有三到四次对话的力量。之后我可能会死。 
6192354999870708 Something <i>would</i> have changed: He'd still be alive.
6192354999870709 一个朋友？有趣...
6192354999870710 Go on, then: Ask him. How do you do it, I wonder? I need to talk to him.
6192354999870707 He said that it hurts. That he never expected it, that it was strange… As if a friend had killed him. He's very sad he didn't get to see you. \nBut he also said nothing would have changed even if you'd gotten here on time.
6192354999870712 当然。再见。
6192354999870713 让我和我父亲说话，然后我就走。
6192354999870711 我需要休息...Can you come back later, please? I don't feel so well right now…
6192354999976175 Why, exactly?
6192355001452816 你瞧，这不是我主意，是学者的，是城镇大厅的主意。不过这地方确实对你不好。
6192354999976174 What do you mean? Don't you dare! No one can replace me!
6192354999976178 Fair enough. You're irreplaceable.
6192355001594771 They'll have to manage. I'll find a way to take you away from here.
6192354999976177 No one else knows how to care for them. No one else knows how to listen. No one else will whisper them kind words!\nEach of them is like kin to me. I feel them listening to my lullabies…
6192354999976651 Well, are you happy now?
6192354999976652 Have they stopped screaming?
6192354999976250 It's quieter…
6192354999976654 But they have enough space now. That's what matters.
6192354999976655 Do you know about a creature that lives underground? Looks like a rat?
6192354999976653 They are scared. I feel like something terrible has happened. But I don't understand… they're silent. They stopped talking to me.
6192354999976657 Thought so.
6192354999976658 It seems I've made a mistake…
6192354999976656 There are no creatures underground. Only the earth, and the dead becoming earth. The earth and the dead are the same. Connected through their shared life.
6192354999976682 I do pity your dead. But I tend to the living. They're more important.
6192354999976683 Forgive me.
6192355001452796 Saved your life, girl. The dead were tearing you apart.
6192354999976681 Oh, what have you done… What have you done!
6192354999976685 I'm sorry.
6192354999976684 No. It's the dead who are important. The living can take care of themselves. The dead can't.
6192354999976687 Okay. Whatever you say.
6192354999976688 Maybe I can make it up to you.
6192354999976686 Don't come here anymore. I don't want to see you… for some time.
6192355001452798 You're more important than corpses. Without you, who would console the future dead?
6192355001452799 You'll understand one day.
6192355001452797 You didn't save anything. You don't understand.
6192355001452801 Yes.
6192355001452802 I sensed them.
6192355001452800 Did you hear them? Did you?
6192355001452804 I don't. How was I able to do that? You're the only one that can.
6192355001452806 I do. They're… different. Unlike anything else in the world.
6192355001452807 I do. They're cold, smothered, and in pain.
6192355001452803 Do you understand now?
6192355001452809 …That's a hell of a comparison.
6192355001594770 They don't burn us, only smother.
6192355001594769 Well, those horrors have visited us as well… but I'd rather not tell you about it.
6192355001452812 No. One must not burn the living.
6192355001452808 They're unique. Not like us. They forget the simple, and learn the inexplicable.\nThey have their own tongue… like your people, the Kin. Not everyone understands the Kin—but then they don't go and burn you, do they!
6192355001452811 The thread worked. I've heard them.
6192355001452810 Well… I put a piece of thread in your pocket. Single-use.
6192355001452814 I won't. I understand now. We'll let everything stay as it was.
6192355001452815 I won't touch the dead. But I'm not so sure about you.
6192355001452813 I mean… don't kill the living. Or the dead.\nSo forget my complaining, all right? It was just momentary… It hurts, but that's fine. They hurt more. Just don't do anything bad to them…
6192354999989611 格蕾丝, this is a graveyard. This is where the dead belong.
6192355001594767 Are the graves overflowing?
6192354999989610 You! You brought new bodies, didn't you? Please, enough. Stop bringing them here. There's so many of them, I can barely hear…
6192354999989613 They don't care anymore, kid.
6192355001452792 Then we must burn them. There's no other way. Or they'll smother you.
6192354999989612 The earth is cramped. No more space. They trample each other, they wail!
6192354999989615 You're imagining things, 格蕾丝.
6192354999989622 Perhaps, but the living are more important.
6192355001452763 So that's why you come apart at the seams. Too many dead to console?
6192354999989614 No! They care! They feel! And there's no peace for them now.\nThat's all they need: consolation and peace. There is no one more miserable, more helpless than the dead—can't you see that?
6192354999989619 They feel nothing, kid. They're dead.
6192355001594768 Do they hurt…?
6192354999989618 Imagine fifty people crammed into this room. You can't bend your knees, can't turn, can't scratch your back, can't even shrug. And it lasts for <i>days.</i> How would you feel? It's torture!
6192354999989621 There, there… Don't cry.
6192354999989623 Not really a suitable job for a young girl…
6192354999989620 No, doctor! You don't believe me, do you? Go and listen! Go listen to those huge graves—they dump people there by the dozen!
6192355001452765 All right, sweetie. Just stop crying.
6192355001452766 I see what the issue is.
6192355001452764 Too many. All of them so cold… You don't believe me, do you? Go and listen! Go listen to those huge graves—they dump people there by the dozen!
6192355001452794 But they're already dead. They can't feel anything.
6192355001452795 Something has to be sacrificed. Better them than you.
6192355001452793 No! No burning! Then they won't be able to talk to us! The last thread will tear. Hope itself will dissolve. They'll be gone forever—can't you see?
6192355000254852 Tools. Forget it. Here's what I want to know: What business did you have with my 父亲? Old 布拉克?
6192355000254851 What have you got in your pockets?
6192355000254856 So you used to go to his place together? All of you? Everyone on this list here?
6192355000254854 Well… we actually went to his place often. He used to teach us things. Why do you ask?
6192355000254858 What did he want from you?
6192355000254859 Maybe one of you knows how he died, then? Maybe you?
6192355000254860 So you were his friends. Did he have enemies?
6192355000254857 Sometimes we'd all go together, sometimes in twos or threes… sometimes alone. A lot of things happen. Why are you asking? It's not like we bothered him; he invited us.
6192355000254862 Think again.
6192355000254863 Kid, you're clearly hiding something. But it's very important for me to know. Do you understand?
6192355000254861 No, I don't think he would…
6192355000254865 卡佩拉？那是谁？
6192355000254866 奥吉姆斯基's daughter, huh? Why her?
6192355000254864 You know what? Ask 卡佩拉. She's the oldest of us all, and the best explainer. She's a good person, too.
6192355000254868 A… union? What union?
6192355000254869 All right. I'll ask her.
6192355000254867 She is like… a big sister to us all. She put together a union.
6192355000254871 Okay.
6192355000254872 Good. Tight lips are a good skill to have.
6192355000254870 Don't worry about it. Just a union. Of people under fifteen. Anyway, ask her. She might be mad at me if I say too much.
6192355000254874 Is it a good thing or a bad thing that they're different?
6192355000254875 Good.
6192355000254873 胖维拉德的女儿。 But she's not like him at all. She even lives in a separate wing of the house.
6192355000697602 你究竟在做什么？
6192355001592751 I'm glad you're alive too.
6192355000697601 I'm so happy you're still alive! Are you looking for shelter, too? But you can't hide in the Cathedral. Only in the Tower. Or <i>on</i> the Tower, anyway…
6192355000697604 Who is gathering in the Tower?
6192355000697603 Everyone is gathering in the Tower. Me… I'm mustering up the resolve to follow. It's not easy… I'm very scared of heights.
6192355000697606 So you all crossed an infected district? You're nuts!
6192355000697607 Why the hell did you abandon your houses?! Why did I even bother to take care of you?
6192355001592752 I hope you're right.
6192355000697605 All the Town's children. Bit by bit… The Tower accepts kids, you know. It will protect us.\nThey're on the stairs now.
6192355000771964 How's it going, cub?
6192355001415584 Don't you mean "seventy-five"?
6192355000771963 Twenty-four… Thirty-three… Seven… Seven-and-five…
6192355001415586 “母亲”？“父亲”？
6192355001415587 …Did they tell you that from underground? Do you still… talk to them?
6192355001446925 It'll take you a long time to count all the dead. Your hair will turn grey.
6192355001415585 Mother said she'll teach me numbers. 父亲 will do letters. Then they'll let me get back to work. I'll stay at the cemetery and count the dead. Count them, and then write it down.\nThat's fine. If that's what I need to do to go back there, I'll do it.
6192355001415589 …They couldn't have said that.
6192355001415590 So they adopted you too, now? It never ends…
6192355001415588 My foster parents. Alexander and 卡特琳娜. The governor's family took me in.
6192355001415592 卡特琳娜的死亡。
6192355001415593 Alexander's dead.
6192355001415594 They're both dead.
6192355001415591 为什么？
6192355001415596 Oh… I forgot who I'm talking to. So they adopted you?
6192355001415595 So what?
6192355001415599 She's right, I guess.
6192355001415602 You could run off at night.
6192355001515959 I thought you and Peter became friends. I kind of expected you'd stay with him.
6192355001415598 Only, I don't want to leave that nice apartment with the pictures. It smells so sweet: paint, twyrine… carraway, for some reason. And there's music in the window.\nBut 卡特琳娜 says I can't stay there. She says we have to be together.
6192355001415605 It was… an underground heartbeat. It has stopped.
6192355001415606 You know… it'll be calmer for them now, in this new Earth. I think.
6192355001415604 You know, I pressed my ear to the ground today, as I always do… and something has changed. There used to be a murmur, but now it's gone. Do you think it's because there are too many of them now?
6192355001446920 They had a different daughter before.
6192355001446921 Forget it. Bad choice of words.
6192355001446919 What do you mean?
6192355001446923 It didn't end well. But perhaps it'll go better with you.
6192355001446924 Forget about it. I'm happy you've found each other.
6192355001446922 And?
6192355001446927 Nothing. So your parents are teaching you?
6192355001446926 So what?
6192355001515961 Fair enough. But you can visit him sometimes.
6192355001515962 She shouldn't have said that…
6192355001515960 So did I… but Mother said I can't. He forgets about me sometimes. And no one brings him milk and bread, for some reason…
6192355001599586 I'll take care of him myself. Cure him. Don't worry.
6192355001141175 Yeah… he's not dead.
6192355001513120 Actually, he's the one who's supposed to take care of you.
6192355001513121 I'll take you in… later. When this is all over.
6192355001141174 I don't know how to care for him…
6192355001409352 How are you doing, kid?
6192355001409351 Quiet… Quiet…
6192355001409354 Who's "we"? You're alone here.
6192355001409355 You look very pale. Do you have all you need here? Food?
6192355001409353 We're fine.
6192355001409357 The place is a mess… no wonder there's grass growing here!
6192355001409358 Yes. That was his name.
6192355001409356 See that little blade of grass growing through the floor? That's Peter.
6192355001409360 So <i>that's</i> why you're barely alive. You need to get some good sleep. You hear me?
6192355001409361 Don't. I'll take you in… if we survive all this.
6192355001409359 I'm his keeper now. He wants me to go to the Tower.
6192355001409363 Take care, kid.
6192355001513129 No. I'm your family.
6192355001513132 Just wait here a little while longer… All right?
6192355001409362 He's my family now.
6192355001409366 Meaning?
6192355001513127 Then stay here for now… and stay alive. Both of you.
6192355001409365 Not at all. He's a living person.
6192355001409369  
6192355001409368  
6192355001409371 Of course. Even adults need them, sometimes.
6192355001409372 You'll have to learn, 格蕾丝.
6192355001409370 He's real. But I don't know how to care for him! I'm used to singing lullabies, but I don't know what to do with the living! Do they like lullabies?
6192355001409374 You're a good kid.
6192355001409375 Peter? I'm not sure he's good at teaching communication…
6192355001513128 I'll take you in when the time comes.
6192355001599587 Just don't get too close to him, all right? He can hear your lullaby from afar just fine.
6192355001409373 Peter will teach me. It's warm here. I… I like this place.
6192355001513123 The plague.
6192355001513124 Everything.
6192355001513122 What?
6192355001513126 This Peter… he doesn't hurt you in any way, does he?
6192355001513125 It won't ever be over. But that's okay. It's all okay.
6192355001362400 What does that mean, 格蕾丝?
6192355001438851 You've always been one…
6192355001362399 I'll be the Mistress of the Dead.
6192355001438853 Weird colors… It's hard to tell white from silver. What's the difference?
6192355001438854 Musky? Is that a color, too?
6192355001438852 Did you know that the north wind is silver, the east wind is musky, the dawn wind is white, and the west wind is violet?
6192355001438856 So why do most winds have colors, but this one has a smell? It's an odd classification.
6192355001438855 Of course not. It's a smell. And a taste, too.
6192355001438858 I guess you're right.
6192355001438859 What about red, blue, white, and black?
6192355001438857 But it's more interesting this way. If the winds were red, blue, yellow, and green, they'd be very bland, don't you think?
6192355001438861 I guess.
6192355001438862 Why did you tell me this?
6192355001438860 I've seen that somewhere before.
6192355001438864 Well… I'm glad the dead will have their own Mistress. For personal reasons.
6192355001438867 Just take care of yourself, all right?
6192355001438863 Our Mistresses used to be unbearably straightforward. Black and White. Dark and Light. Evil and Good. Wild and Warm… Too simple.\nIt'll be more compelling now.
6192355001438866 You're right… It's easier to count the living. The rest are dead.
6192355001438868 I hope you take good care of them.
6192355001438869 There are thousands of them, and you're just one girl. Well, not just any girl… a Mistress.
6192355001438865 You're not the only one. This town has more dead than living, now.
6192355001499058  
6192355001499057  
6192355001512360 I'll cure you.
6192355001512361 Anything.
6192355001512362 I'll try. And… thank you for saying this.
6192355001512365 I know what you want to ask. But 斯塔马丁 won't leave.
6192355001512359 Hello. I recognize you. I can feel you though this cloth. You're… you. 布拉克's son. No… just 布拉克. Your name is 阿泰米, I remember. It doesn't matter that you're a son… I misspoke… You're on your own… right? Right. On your own.\nI… I want to ask something of you.
6192355001512364 You'll live. You hear me? You'll live!
6192355001512370 That idiot… That moron…
6192355001512363 This architect… he's an artist… and he's… he's… he's my new friend! And I… I don't want him to die.\nBut he refuses to leave, to leave me alone. Let… Let him… take him away from here! Away from me!
6192355001512372 Does he talk to you like 父亲 did?
6192355001512374 I've already failed him once.
6192355001512373 Peter is dead, but you're still alive. I want to take care of you first.
6192355001512371 You don't understand. Peter needs help. Today is the last day.
6192355001512378 Hand it over.
6192355001512383 I will.
6192355001512384 All right.
6192355001591973 安德烈也死了。我很抱歉。
6192355001512377 You're the only one I have left. Take this key. Give it to 安德烈—today. He'll understand.
6192355001512388 We won't say goodbye. But for another reason.
6192355001512389 Don't you dare. People need you here—the living and the dead.
6192355001512393 I'm sorry.
6192355001512379 And you know what… let's not say goodbye, all right? No one ever truly leaves, you know.
6192355001512386 Maybe he grew attached to you? He won't leave you.
6192355001512392 I'll give him a protective pill.
6192355001512385 He'll get sick… It's dangerous for him here! Dangerous to be with me…
6192355001512391 Tell me.
6192355001512390 Yes. And I want to do something good. While there's still anything of him left… and of me.
6192355001519915 You belong here. I knew it the moment I saw you.
6192355001526339 Aren't you cold here? Lonely? Sad? Uncomfortable? How do you even survive in the winter…?
6192355001526340 Yeah… those people had no idea. Made rush decisions. Wanted to drag you away from here… Nonsense.
6192355001519914 I'm glad I stayed here.
6192355001591975 我很抱歉。
6192355001591976 He will. They're inseparable even in death.
6192355001591974 Oh… there's no need then. Peter will give it to his brother himself…
6192354999900451 格蕾丝
6192355001258461 格蕾丝
6192354999870715 驼背...?小子，我是痛得弯腰！
6192354999870716 你是哪种狗狗？
6192354999870717 闭嘴，杂种。对我来说再送一个人上西天也不会费太多功夫。
6192354999870714 作为驼背你打得不错！但是伙计，你搞砸了！这三个家伙死了，我看见是你做的。你麻烦大了。
6192354999870720 我知道。
6192354999870721 不需要你教导我，孩子。我是个外科医生。
6192354999870719 你需要处理流血，老大爷。你浑身都是血。你自己的血！
6192354999870723 <i>我</i>的灵魂？这些可怜的家伙才需要你的帮助。
6192354999870724 如果我及时止血我就死定了。要是有个绷带就好了... 
6192354999870722 我是一个看门狗，照看你的灵魂。不等等，我是一个导盲犬，在你死的时候我会指引你的灵魂前往正确的地方。 
6192354999870726 谢谢。你是一个好小子。
6192354999870727 止血带？不，谢了。我宁愿不碰皮革。
6192354999870725 给你。一个止血带！它使用我的皮革做的，不过...似乎你更需要它。
6192354999870729 实际上...当然。拿过来。落到这境地不能无视帮助。
6192354999870730 我会处理的。
6192354999870728 或者你想要我的项圈吗？你可以用它来捆绑你的腿。 
6192354999870732 是吗？那什么是正确的做法？ 
6192354999870733 孩子， "在这附近"一点也不特别。
6192354999870734 我会自己处理的。这是我要承受的罪孽——我不需要说教。 
6192354999870731 哥们，怒确实有股暴脾气！叮！咚！啪！三个人挂了！这个不是正确的做法。附近的人可不会这么行事。
6192354999870736 是的，我很擅长切割人体。
6192354999870737 你有什么东西我可以用来止血吗？
6192354999870735 吼，我看见了。你的确很擅长切割人体，如同本能反应一般。人体切割机！
6192354999870739 我会..铭记于心。
6192354999870740 我的方法更安全。
6192354999870738 你要发发善心！只要揍他们三下。他们就会逃走了！你并不需要杀掉所有妨碍你的人！嚯嚯！
6192354999870742 我懂。我就是这出生的。
6192354999870743 如果这里的每个人都像你这样...那样的话也许你是对的。
6192354999870741 但是小镇<i>很</i> 特殊。我的意思是 <i>镇民</i>挺普通的。但是小镇... 
6192354999870745 我别无选择！
6192354999870746 我不会向任何人道歉。我这是自卫。 
6192354999870744 哦，哥们，你陷入大麻烦了！两个逃走的家伙会把整个镇子都搅乱的。风水轮流转！他们肯定会让你道歉的。踩在你的背上。把你踏入土里。
6192355000175558 [我们谈话吧]
6192355000175559 [不感兴趣]
6192355000175557 [a conversation about how the fight could have gone better, and about innovative wound-dressing]
6192354999870748 你是谁，孩子？
6192354999870749 我不是来这里躲藏的。
6192354999870750 我 <i>感觉</i> 好多了。谢谢你当时帮我。 
6192354999870747 看看你——好多了！但是这个镇不太热情，是吗？\n不用担心。大草原很宽广。它可以隐藏任何人。你来这干啥？
6192354999870752 你一个人在这吗？
6192354999870753 直接告诉我——狗是你毒死的吗？
6192354999870751 你为什么这么问？
6192354999870755 ...是你吗，伙计？
6192354999870756 我们不是朋友，孩子。所以这里只有我们两个人。这就意味着你是一个人。
6192354999870754 不。一切安静。这里只有我们三个人——你我和两个好朋友。
6192354999870758 他们还说你是个可悲的小流氓。
6192354999870759 但有个罪犯就做了这种事，躲在这附近的某个地方。你见过他吗？
6192354999870757 如你所愿！无论如何，你不能躲避自己。他们就是这么说的。
6192354999870761 所以，是真的...老实说我很惊讶。
6192354999870762 解释一下。
6192354999870760 彻头彻尾的谎言！我是个好人，善良的人。
6192354999870764 大草原对你没有帮助。它不需要杀气腾腾的小崽子。
6192354999870765 你为什么这么做，你这个小混蛋？你为什么要杀狗？
6192354999870763 不，大草原上拥有一百只眼睛。它看到一切，记住一切。别管我了，杀手。我可能最终会对你有用。
6192354999870767 我在找那个毒死男孩们的狗的小流氓。知道他在哪里吗？
6192354999870768 你是谁，孩子？
6192354999870766 不客气。我会告诉你，“抓挠我的背，抓挠你的背”，但我不是那种要求抓挠背的人。那你想要什么？需要换个伤口包扎吗？
6192354999870770 “打中要害”？我认为他们是对的。这个世界不需要像你这样的人。
6192354999870771 拿一会这个止血带，好吗？
6192354999870772 你简直令人作呕。给我滚蛋。
6192354999870769 Soul-and-a-Halves是真正的流氓，而诺克金是其中最差劲的。小流氓应该受折磨，对吧？\n但是你伤害不了他们。他们只是擦去血迹继续前进。所以你需要打中<i>要害</i> 。直击内心。让他们看看感觉如何！
6192354999870774 我也答应孩子们做正确的事。所以，给你这个：他们送的礼物。
6192354999870775 我确实尊重我的债务。希望就算我放你走也算数。
6192354999870776 给我消失……我才不会用你的血弄脏我的手！
6192354999870773 不，不，饶了我！我们是朋友！我帮了你，不是吗？你欠我的！\n 这对你有什么意义吗？让我走。也许我对你有用！
6192354999870778 我不需要你的任何东西。滚蛋！ 
6192354999870779 是的...那可能会有用，实际上。  在城镇大厅等我。
6192354999870780 萨普洛夫…?
6192354999870777 好极了！所以你走吧。\n 顺便说一句，如果你需要任何人来确认你只是<i>今天早上<i>才到，并且昨晚不能谋杀任何人，尽管发话好了。我要跑去向萨普洛夫作证。
6192354999870782 好。在城镇大厅等我。我会在那儿的。
6192354999870783 没有你我会过也能处理。我不需要卑鄙小人的帮助。
6192354999870781 我们的吸血鬼总管。他五年来碌碌无为，所以他的手现在他们很想勒死别人。他称之为“正义”。\n但是……他会在乎证人证词的。他是个吸血鬼，但他是个有原则的吸血鬼。你想去那边吗？
6192354999939958 你是这里的狗，不是我。把它戴上。 
6192354999940151 ...好吧，你说服了我。
6192354999939957 它也不需要那些不能独立思考的人。”“抓住他，”他们命令，你立刻咬下去。放我走，老兄。做个好孩子。
6192354999870785 所以他们根本没有伤害你？
6192354999870786 …你没事吧？好像有什么问题。
6192354999870787 所以你得到了应有的惩罚，嗯？
6192354999870784 首先，留下来！然后，开始玩！
6192354999870789 不，我们不是朋友。
6192354999870790 我是外来人？我可是当地人。而且我们之前见过！ 
6192354999870788 你朋友？外乡人，当心！
6192354999870792 你真的要让这个笑话奏效，得多花些努力。多么愚蠢的恶作剧。
6192354999870793 不，你是个好孩子！继续做好工作。
6192354999870791 不要碰。坏孩子！坏孩子
6192354999870795 这场埋伏是怎么回事？他们等我多久了？
6192354999870796 其他人呢？
6192354999870794 拿刀的那个是Kirik。皮革工人。不用为他哭泣——这家伙是个脑残。 
6192354999870798 那谁才是他们真正的目标？
6192354999870799 一场“意外”？这种意外在这种地方很寻常吗？
6192354999870797 他们不是在等你。我想 <i>你</i>完全是意外。
6192354999870801 你眼光还真是敏锐。
6192354999870802 搞兼职抢劫呢？那拿到罐头厂不发工钱？ 
6192354999870800 我怎么知道？罐头厂工人。你可以从他们手掌看出来。 
6192354999870804 听着，我只想知道他们为什么袭击我。 
6192354999870803 四双眼睛？这可不是开玩笑。
6192354999870806 好孩子。
6192354999870807 我希望不是真的。这个小镇今天已经见了够多的血了。
6192354999870805 我不知道。附近有传言说某个今天夜里被谋杀了。我想我应该四处闻闻，找找看…谁知道呢？也许是真的。
6192354999870809 确实，无风不起浪。
6192354999870810 我可不太相信命运。
6192354999870811 所以他们为什么袭击我？
6192354999870808 有时。但事情通常进展顺利，每个人都会遇到他们注定的命运。生死有命,富贵在天！
6192354999936856 利卡
6192354999870813 你看到了什么？
6192354999870814 你会为什么希望我走远点？
6192354999870815 他们怎么称呼你，小孩？
6192354999870812 走远点。没人看到我，但是我看到了一切。
6192354999870817 你看见打斗了？
6192354999870818 你看见我下火车了？
6192354999870816 所有事情。
6192354999870820 你看见打斗了？
6192354999870821 你看见我下火车了？
6192354999870819 没。
6192354999870823 你看见打斗了？
6192354999870824 你看见我下火车了？
6192354999870822 我不是小孩子。没有人称呼过我。
6192354999870826 没关系。你不必爱我。
6192354999870827 也许还是有的。
6192354999870828 重要的是，你看到我黎明时分到达。对吗？
6192354999870825 你有什么值得爱的？没有什么。所以我不。
6192354999870830 我需要<i>你<i>。所以不要去任何地方，好吗？
6192354999870831 好吧…也许我们会成为朋友。当你长大一点。
6192354999870832 老实说，我也不需要你。你不是很友好。
6192354999870829 我不需要你。嗯。没有你一切都很好。好极了。
6192354999870834 为什么？
6192354999870835 墓园可不是一个寂寞女孩应该待的地方。
6192354999870833 格蕾丝。
6192354999870837 自杀...?
6192355001638998 是的…我已经知道了。
6192355001638999 我明白了…还好我没管她。
6192354999870836 她在自杀。格蕾丝就是这样，但她不在乎。
6192354999870839 你在害怕什么？
6192354999870838 感到害怕
6192354999870841 怎么做到的？好像有不同的方法…
6192354999870842 用她的头碰他们？什么？
6192354999870840 真的能和死者说话。用她的头碰他们。但这会杀死生者。我告诉她，事情不是这么做的！但她不听…
6192354999870844 等一会。我去看看格蕾丝的情况。
6192354999870845 好，我们走吧。
6192355001639002 稍等我一下。
6192354999870843 还有另一种方法。我可以展示给你看。来吧。不过步子迈小一点。
6192354999870847 我想见识 <i>一下…</i>
6192354999870848 那会害死她吗？
6192354999870846 对。用她的头碰他们。
6192354999870850 你知道？
6192354999870849 告诉她不要这样做！告诉她她做错了！告诉她我知道该怎么做。
6192354999870852 但是你知道其他法子，是吗？
6192354999870853 克拉拉是谁？
6192354999870851 没错。克拉拉说格蕾丝如果在做三次就会彻底死去。 
6192354999870855 什么方法？
6192354999870854 我的新朋友。她也说我的方法更好。 
6192354999870857 你在这做什么？
6192354999870858 你为什么这么沮丧？
6192354999870856 …
6192354999870860 不再是谁的朋友了？
6192354999870861 你在这干啥？
6192354999870859 你为什么来这里？我不需要你。这里没有人需要你。不管怎样，我们不再是她的朋友了。
6192354999870863 放松。他睡着了。
6192354999870864 你说你会展现给我怎么跟死人说话……
6192354999870862 所以？
6192354999870866 不。她和你我一样活着。
6192354999870867 你说你会展现给我怎么跟死人说话……
6192354999870865 她也许死了。
6192354999870869 那我们走吧。
6192354999870868 对。我知道另一种方式。
6192354999870871 我会背着你。跳上来。
6192354999870872 你为什么不能跑？
6192354999870870 走慢点。我的腿很短。我不能跑。
6192354999870874 不礼貌？
6192354999870873 这很不礼貌。
6192354999870876 好吧，现有道理。让我抱着你。
6192354999870877 好的。我们慢慢走。
6192354999870878 没事。大地和我是老朋友了。
6192354999870875 对。它会使大地疯狂。毕竟它是活的。
6192354999870880 是的。
6192354999870881 你是认真的吗？你真的能做到？ 
6192354999870879 你想知道怎么做吗？如何与地面上的人们交谈？
6192355000232037 你在这做什么，小不点？
6192355000232038 我明白了。
6192355000232039 你看到一个满脸雀斑的精力充沛的男孩从这里出来了吗？
6192355000232036 我为什么要爱你？我根本不需要爱你。我可以随时停止爱你。
6192355000232041 如果你不想的话，你不必告诉我。
6192355000232044 所以你为什么来这？
6192355000232040 没，没有男孩。没人出来。 
6192355000232043 怎么了？告诉我。
6192355000232045 你想让我带你回家吗？你住在哪里？
6192355000232042 …
6192355000232047 公鸡?
6192355000232048 我不能，我很忙。
6192355000232046 我们去抓几只公鸡吧。我给你看些东西。
6192355000232050 对小女孩而言不是个适合居住的地方。
6192355000237251 火车车厢？里面一定很冷。
6192355000237252 全靠你自己？那可不太好。
6192355000232049 我独自住在火车车厢里。你知道，我有一个非常丰富多彩的…东西，我忘了它叫什么了。我把它挂在对面的墙上。
6192355000237254 那还真是了不起。
6192355000237255 我们走吧。
6192355000237253 是一种上面有鸡冠的草。我知道各种各样的草。他们向我展示他们自己。我比那些舞动的女孩更了解她们。
6192355000237257 你知道吗，孩子？你要离开火车车厢。来和我一起生活吧。
6192355000237258 行。我会记住的。
6192355000237256 我们现在不去。我们晚上去吧。到我的火车车厢来，用我们的秘密敲门。像这样：敲两下，一下，两下。
6192355000237260 我去找点东西。
6192355000237261 食物……没关系，我去弄点东西。
6192355000237259 我不想和你住在一起。我为什么要和你住在一起？我可能会来看看。也许可以和你一起住一会儿，如果你有食物的话。
6192355000415052 看看谁在说话。你上次洗澡是什么时候？
6192355000419717 那你为什么不整理一下呢？应该不太难。
6192355000415051 你这地方真乱啊。
6192355000419719 忙着做啥？
6192355000419720 我也是，小不点。
6192355000419718 我没时间。太忙了。
6192355000419722 真的？会说哈？
6192355000419723 很好。有朋友总是很好的。
6192355000419724 一个洋娃娃？
6192355000419721 我有了一个新朋友。会说话的朋友。
6192355000419726 那是谁？
6192355000419725 不是洋娃娃，
6192355000419728 大多数人都不喜欢我。
6192355000419729 就像你一样，哈。
6192355000419730 好吧，我不会窥探你的秘密。
6192355000419727 她是个秘密朋友。我不知道为什么，但她一点也不喜欢你。
6192355000464471 你的朋友为什么不喜欢我，穆克?
6192355000464472 你现在不孤单真是太好了。
6192355000464470 我为什么要喜欢你？我现在喜欢我的新...朋友。我会说话的朋友。
6192355000464474 很奇怪。通常，这是人们唯一喜欢我的地方。
6192355000464475 唉……我本该当冰淇淋销售员的。
6192355000464473 …她说是因为你是医生。她不喜欢那样。
6192355000419732 哦，这是新的。你不是说你不喜欢我吗？
6192355000419733 不，我想我现在不能收养个女儿。
6192355000419736 "某种程度上"是什么意思?
6192355000419731 我不知道…也许我可以成为你的女儿，某种程度上。
6192355000419735 你为什么说他很坏？
6192355000419739 不，我更遭。
6192355000419734 嗯，好吧。你没有你爸爸那么坏。
6192355000419738 你不相信我吗？
6192355000419737 某种程度上。
6192355000419741 好吧？
6192355000419742 你是个闷闷不乐的孩子，是吗？
6192355000419740 …
6192355000419744 你的那个朋友到底是谁？
6192355000419748 任何一个小洞？那倒是很方便。
6192355000419743 我朋友就是这么说的。她知道全世界的一切，因为她可以潜入任何一个小洞。
6192355000419746 You do that.
6192355000419747 我也没那么想见她。
6192355000419745 也许我会介绍你。她问了很多关于你的事，但还不想见你。
6192355000419750 Who is your friend, 穆克? Is she human?
6192355000420761 I don't have time for games, 穆克. Can't you see I'm busy making a cure?
6192355000419749 My friend told me she's ready to meet you. That's what she said, she did.
6192355000420752 Then what?
6192355000420764 That friend of yours… Is she so sneaky because people are looking for her?
6192355000420765 Why is she afraid of me, 穆克?
6192355000420751 No. 
6192355000420754 How does she talk to you, kiddo?
6192355000420766 This is troubling… Tell her we can meet.
6192355000465463 You and I might have a friend in common, actually… Does yours have burning eyes and wear a long-nosed mask?
6192355000420753 I can't tell.
6192355000420756 Then how can I meet her?
6192355000420755 Inside.
6192355000420758 Tell her I will be there.
6192355000420759 I have a bad feeling about this friend of yours.
6192355000420760 Why not the graveyard, then? No. You go keep your friend company.
6192355000420757 My friend said that if you come to the Crow Stone at night, she'll show herself.
6192355000420763 Scared of what?
6192355000420762 That's why she wants to see you. She's scared.
6192355000465465 I was just joking.
6192355000465466 Not yet.
6192355000465467 Then she's no friend of mine.
6192355000465464 No… Do you have a friend like that?
6192355000464477 Hey, kiddo… Are you, by any chance, sick? Lemme take a look…
6192355000464478 No, I don't have anything for you.
6192355000464476 Did you bring me anything yummy?
6192355000464480 Everyone's dying from it, 穆克.
6192355000464491 You should be.
6192355000464479 Well… I'm not scared of this plague at all.
6192355000464482 I'm a doctor. I'm saving people from the sand plague.
6192355000464481 Then why do you go away for so long?
6192355000464484 Who told you that?
6192355000464495 That's very brave of you!
6192355000464483 Not everyone dies from it. Only people who are scared, and I'm not scared at all.
6192355000464486 Do you mean 克拉拉? Is she your new friend?
6192355000464489 I don't think your friend knows much about medicine.
6192355000464485 My new friend.
6192355000464488 Okay, I see. I had imaginary friends, too.
6192355000464490 Yeah, sure.
6192355000464487 No, it's not 克拉拉 at all. It's my special friend. She's always with me.
6192355000464493 I know that it's deadly, 穆克. Nobody's recovered from it.
6192355000464494 So you know someone who got sick and didn't die?
6192355000464492 You don't know anything. Some doctor you are.
6192355001225973 Because if you're infected, but you don't die, that means… means… never mind. It means nothing.
6192355001225974 There's a rumor circulating around that the carrier of the pest is an orphan girl. Show me your tongue.
6192355001225978 Because I'm a doctor and I said so. Look at the light and let me examine your pupils.
6192355001225972 为什么？
6192355001225976 …True. No signs of the disease.
6192355001225977 Yeah… It's all nonsense, of course. You can't be a carrier. I don't even need a blood sample…
6192355001225975 I'm not sick! Nope, not me. Never am. I don't even get colds, not even when I'm soaked and barefoot.
6192355000464497 I'm not asking around.
6192355000464498 Not really.
6192355000464504 Friends? I'm in.
6192355000464496 My friend wants to know: Why do you keep asking everyone about her? Do you want to make friends with her, too?
6192355000464500 That's not true about the earth.
6192355000464505 Were you listening by the window?
6192355000464499 My friend wants you to know you shouldn't touch those who live in the ground! And don't hurt the earth, either. If you cut the earth, or cure it, nothing will grow there anymore.\nSee? My friend is good.
6192355000464503 A lot of interesting creatures live underground.
6192355000464509 Yeah. Dead people live there, too.
6192355000464510 Shoes or hooves. It can have one, not both. Make up your mind…
6192355000464502 I told you everything I needed to. There's an awesome worm living underground, too. It has two belly spots—blue ones—and tiny little shoes. And hooves.
6192355000464525 What are you doing here?
6192355000465487 You will go home right this minute.
6192355000465474 Is this 穆克's friend? There's another little girl hiding inside you, isn't there?
6192355000464524 She's almost… almost here. She just won't come out for some reason. I need to go… call her, I guess.
6192355000464528 Why can't she get close to me?
6192355000464529 I'll find your friend myself, and I'll decide if you should even be friends with someone like that. Go home.
6192355000464527 I just wanted… I wanted to show you that she's not really evil at all. I wanted to take her by the hand and bring her to you. She can't just get close to you like that if she's not with me. But if she's with me, she can.
6192355000464531 Very well, let's see. But I won't wait long. If nobody comes out in ten minutes, we're going home.
6192355000465492 A lure? That's right! You know she's not your friend!
6192355000464530 You should go hide behind those rocks and wait. Just keep looking at me. I'll wait for her, sort of like a lure. She'll come to the fire when she thinks I'm alone. Then you'll see I'm not making her up.
6192355000465478 Then what is it?
6192355000465477 No. Not a girl, not one, not inside.
6192355000465480 Is that why you brought me here? You made it all up, didn't you?
6192355000465481 I'll try to be home more often. Go home, little one. I don't like that new friend of yours.
6192355000465482 I suppose I don't even have a home. Can you really call that place a home?
6192355000465479 I'm picking a family for myself. I think I'm going to be together with my friend. We'll be sisters… or maybe she can even be my mommy. \nAnd I don't have any reason to like you. You're never even home.
6192355000465484 She's dangerous. I think I know what she really is.
6192355000465485 Call it a hunch.
6192355000465486 You should just listen to me, like you would to your 父亲. Understood?
6192355000465483 为什么？
6192355000465489 Soon.
6192355000465490 I don't know.
6192355000465491 That's up to your friend—hopefully, former friend.
6192355000465488 When are you coming home?
6192355000465494 I'll take a look and tell you later.
6192355000465495 There's nothing to <i>know</i> here. Just trust me.
6192355000465493 You don't know that!
6192355000467681 "Again"? What do you mean, "again"?
6192355000467703 What did you fight about?
6192355000467704 Don't worry about it. I bet it's something silly.
6192355000467680 I had a fight with 史迪奇, all because of your 父亲 again! I'm so worried now… What if we never make up?
6192355000467701 Really? Everyone?
6192355000467705 I know why you feel this way, 穆克…
6192355000467700 Because! Everything is bad because of your dad. He always made everyone sad.
6192355000467707 But he really didn't kill your parents. The disease did.
6192355000467708 He didn't want to do it, 穆克.
6192355000467706 I do.
6192355000467710 Why do you think so?
6192355000467709 Yes, he did.
6192355000467712 Why isn't it?
6192355000467713 No, he's good. He was. It's true.
6192355000467711 史迪奇 says that your 父亲 is good, that he was smart and kind to people. But I know that's not true.
6192355000467715 How do you know that?
6192355000467716 Is your friend telling you things again?
6192355000467722 What did my 父亲 even do to you?
6192355000467714 If it weren't for him, we would be living like we used to, and nothing would be bad.
6192355000467718 Well… I guess there's no convincing you otherwise.
6192355000467729 Don't cry, little one. Please don't cry.
6192355000467717 I know because I feel that way.
6192355000467720 Are you sure?
6192355000467721 I guess she overrules me and 史迪奇, then.
6192355000467719 My friend would never lie, you know. She talks about it, too.
6192355000467724 That's new. Where did you hear that?
6192355001224632 I know why you feel this way, 穆克…
6192355000467723 Your dad… He killed my parents.
6192355000467726 Someone told you a ridiculous lie!
6192355000467727 Damn… The First Outbreak…
6192355000467728 穆克, he didn't kill them. They died from the plague. He had no choice.
6192355000467725 That's what I heard. He locked them up so they couldn't go outside, so they got sick and died. I was just two years old.
6192355000467731 You'll make up. I'm sure of it.
6192355000467732 Where did that rascal find it?
6192355000467733 Of course you don't hate having a brother…
6192355000467730 I hope I can make up with 史迪奇… I don't hate having a brother at all. He grumbles a lot, but he's really nice. He makes food for me. Yesterday, he brought me sugar! He put it over a candle and made a piece of candy…
6192355000772152 I guess. Do you like it?
6192355001368951 There's no reason for us to stay in the den below the Factory.
6192355000772151 Is this our new house?
6192355001368953 I think I know which one you'll take…
6192355001368954 Be my guest. There's plenty of room for everyone.
6192355001368955 No. I'll do that myself.
6192355001368952 Can I choose a room for myself?
6192355000849852 Swevery?
6192355000849853 I can't hear anything.
6192355000849851 Shh! Listen to swevery grow.
6192355000849855 All right. Go ahead, show me.
6192355000849856 It's beautiful here.
6192355000849857 Do you often come here alone? Aren't you scared?
6192355000849854 Here? Here, I guess… Here.
6192355000849859 It is, but I'm not sure what you want me to do.
6192355000849860 What was it… 穆克? Look at me. Are you messing with me?
6192355000849925 Will these ones do the trick?
6192355000849858 We need swevery. And twyre. A blade of each kind. It's pretty!
6192355000849862 Which plants?
6192355000849926 I've got everything already.
6192355000849861 Now you go pick grass!
6192355000849864 Why don't you do it yourself?
6192355000849865 All right…
6192355000849866 Okay, swevery and three kinds of twyre. Right. Now to fulfill my dream of being an errand boy…
6192355000849863 I just told you! Swevery, and three kinds of twyre. Pretty blades. Don't you know which grass is magic?
6192355000849868 Well, I'm in no hurry.
6192355000849869 Sure, I'll bring you back a whole bushel of herbs.
6192355000849867 I will when I hear it call. But that takes time.
6192355000849871 How do you know all that? About the dead?
6192355000849870 No. I don't cheat.
6192355000849873 They're… they're dead, yes?
6192355000849874 Perhaps you're only imagining that?
6192355000849872 Because that's how I talk to mom and dad.
6192355000849876 Your mom and dad… Who were they?
6192355000849875 No, I'm not! I'm not!
6192355000849878 Five years ago?
6192355000849879 Where did it happen?
6192355000849877 They died. Five years ago. Bad disease. A lot of people died.
6192355000849881 Five years ago? You're barely older than six.
6192355000849882 Oh my…
6192355000849880 Here. We lived in the Crude Sprawl.
6192355000849884 How can you remember that? Impossible.
6192355000849885 Five years ago? You're barely older than six.
6192355000849883 Yes. Five years ago.
6192355000849887 All right, all right, I believe you.
6192355000849888 Why did I even come here…
6192355000995067 I should have gone to see 格蕾丝 first. Hope there's still a chance.
6192355000849886 I don't remember what happened. But mom and dad told me. It's true!
6192355000849908 How can you tell which herbs are magic?
6192355000849909 So what do we do now?
6192355000849907 Yes, these are the right blades. Magic enough.
6192355000849911 So it's all just… daydreaming?
6192355000849912 Ugh, kids. What did I expect? I knew nothing good would come of this.
6192355000849910 What am I supposed to teach? You just need to want it really hard. Close your eyes tight, too. It'll happen.
6192355000849914 Who cares if you need me!
6192355000849915 It's my own fault for taking a kid too seriously.
6192355000849913 I did not lie. I did not. I don't need you. Nuh-uh. At all.
6192355000849917 I'm not imposing myself on you.
6192355000849918 …Don't you have anyone to wipe your face? You're all covered in dirt. See you, grumpy.
6192355000995066 I should have gone to see 格蕾丝 first. Hope there's still a chance.
6192355000849916 What is there about you to love? I don't want to. Nuh-uh.
6192355000849920 I still do.
6192355000849921 I'm just wondering how you think it's possible.
6192355000849919 The ones that grow from a person. A person-in-the-ground, I mean. Like mom and dad. You wanted to talk to your dad, right?
6192355000849923 How? I thought you wanted to teach me.
6192355000849924 What do you mean? What nonsense is this?
6192355000849922 Go ahead, then. Talk to him.
6192355001236774 Very much so.
6192355001236785 No, kiddo. Of course I'm not.
6192355001236786 Are you feeling all right?
6192355001236787 Why did you leave without me?
6192355001236788 What is that supposed to mean? Why are you here?
6192355001236773 …Are you angry with me?
6192355001236790 I'm not sure.
6192355001236800 Like I have a choice…
6192355001236789 Will you forgive me?
6192355001236792 Don't "I'm sorry" me. What happened back there by the fire?
6192355001236793 It's not enough to be sorry.
6192355001236815 Come now… It's me who is sorry.
6192355001236791 I'm sorry.
6192355001236795 All the more reason to stay close to me, not run off into the night.
6192355001236796 So? Have you met your friend?
6192355001236794 I was scared.
6192355001236798 Thank heavens…
6192355001236799 But you weren't scared to run around in the night alone?
6192355001236797 No. I got scared. I don't want to meet her anymore.
6192355001236802 All right, kiddo. Stay here if you need to. I'm… I'm happy you're alive and well.
6192355001236803 I expect to see you home in an hour.
6192355001236804 What is this place, 穆克? Have you been living here long?
6192355001236801 I'll just stay here for a while. And then I'll come home. To our home.
6192355001236806 That's one bold dream. It'd take more than a night to get to the sea from here. More than a week, even.
6192355001236807 Aren't you scared here alone?
6192355001236805 Long? Always. This is… well, it's a boxcar. Broken, I guess. Useless.\nI used to dream that it'd attach to a train while I slept, and I'd wake up and see the sea.
6192355001236809 Oh… Please, no more weird friends. All right?
6192355001236810 Who is here with you, then?
6192355001236808 I'm not alone at all.
6192355001236812 A doll… Well, that's something.
6192355001236813 Let's go home, kiddo. Get a bite to eat, or something.
6192355001236814 You won't ever be alone anymore.
6192355001236811 Guests visit, sometimes. They're not my friends—no one is—but they play next to the boxcar, and I watch through a crack, or from the roof.\nI also have Mother's doll.
6192355001362404 It is beautiful.
6192355001368956 Where did you get this lantern, 穆克?
6192355001368957 And yet it's just a train car.
6192355001362403 Beautiful, isn't it? Like a real home.
6192355001368959 You can't live somewhere and t拉薇尔 at the same time.
6192355001368962 Sounds nice.
6192355001368958 I always wanted to live in a van. Live <i>and</i> t拉薇尔. Looking at live pictures.
6192355001368961 Empty, huh…
6192355001368965 Good idea. You'll keep it company.
6192355001368960 Found it. The Nutshell went empty, so no one needs it anymore, not over there. So it'll live here, with me.
6192355001368964 This place is a bit tight for the two of us…
6192355001368966 How is it icky? It's not icky.
6192355001368967 I'll come back… later. All right?
6192355001368963 Don't just stand there! Choose yourself a corner. This is your new home now.\nYou're not planning to go back to that icky cellar of yours, are you? You've done all you can there. No reason to go back. Nuh huh.
6192355001368969 Fine. Let's live here.
6192355001368970 No. But I will drop by. And we will t拉薇尔 to the sea, one day.
6192355001368971 I'll find a new house for us, big and spacious. Lots of vacant houses around here, now…
6192355001368968 Well… let's live here anyway? Please? I've set it all up for us, see? It's pretty. And warm. And pretty.\nAnd the train car <i>will</i> t拉薇尔 one day. And we'll go to the sea together. Please… Stay?
6192355001499060 I know what that feels like, kiddo. I've experienced it too.
6192355001526326 You don't need water right now, but you'll drink a lot in the future. You hear me? Lots!
6192355001499059 My throat is all dry… Everything is dry. I'd like a drink of water. But… no. No more water for me.
6192355001516852  
6192355001526324  
6192355001516851  
6192355001517552 Remember how you taught me to pick herbs?
6192355001517553 You won't die. You hear? You hear me?
6192355001517562 Forgive me, kiddo. I know I can't save you all. You're right. You don't need me, and there's nothing about me to love.
6192355001517551 Bury me somewhere 'round those rocks. All right? I want to grow into swevery. It'll be pretty…
6192355001517555 I know. You're about to say you don't need me and there's nothing about me to love.
6192355001517554 Yeah…
6192355001517557 Listen to me! I saved you from the sand pest once, and I'll do it again. Just wait a little.
6192355001517558 Forgive me, kiddo…
6192355001517556 I won't say that… I loved you the moment I saw you. Yeah.
6192355001526323 How are you, kiddo?
6192355001526325 You shouldn't be here… Would you like me to carry you home?
6192355001526322 I knew you by the smell.
6192354999921751 穆克
6192355001258463 穆克
6192354999870944 继续。
6192354999870945 但是被告是谁，孩子们？你至少也应该让被告出席吧？
6192354999870946 你到底是谁，小鬼？
6192354999870943 你在这儿。很好。审判可以开始了。
6192354999870948 啊，所以 <i>我</i> 就是被告。
6192354999870949 我是布拉克。毫无疑问。
6192354999870950 什么是真的？这个小镇到处都是流言蜚语？是的，当然是。
6192354999870947 第一个问题：他们说你不是老布拉克的儿子。.\n他是个医生，他挽救了生命。据说你是在杀人。是真的吗？
6192354999870952 我…可能杀了，是的。
6192354999870953 不，听闲聊对你没有好处。
6192354999870954 杀人不一定是谋杀。
6192354999870951 请回答这个问题。你是杀人犯，还是不是？
6192354999870957 你真是放肆，孩子。
6192354999870958 别“冷静”我，孩子。你想让我受审吗？那就继续吧。
6192354999870955 冷静。不需要有戒心。或者你在我的Soul-and-a-Halves面前这么做不舒服？
6192354999870960 杀死那些掠夺弱者和无防备者的人是正确的；对那些罪有应得的人复仇是正确的。
6192354999870961 只能在自卫时。
6192354999870962 只能用来保护所爱之人。
6192354999870963 不。杀人永远不是正确的，不要忘记。 
6192354999870959 告诉我：杀人是对的吗？我们需要知道你相信什么。对我们来说，老布拉克不仅仅是个医生。他是个老师。他知道如何生活。\n 你说你是他的儿子，所以你要代替他回答：谋杀可以接受吗？
6192354999870965 洗耳恭听。
6192354999870966 那就别对我刨根问底了，孩子。想想他们怎么把我描绘成一个危险的人…
6192354999870964 不管放肆与否，这不是游戏。我们在讨论一些重要的事情。
6192354999870968 我是阿泰米·布拉克。 伊西多之子。
6192354999870967 诺克金。<i>老大<i>诺克金就是我。但真正的问题是：你是 <i>谁？</i>
6192354999870970 是的，我是。
6192354999870971 我受够了审问，孩子。别再浪费我的时间了。
6192354999870969 为什么皱眉？…你在想你的父亲，是吗？
6192354999870973 看起来是这样。
6192354999870974 你打算杀谁，小子？
6192354999870972 所以谋杀有时<i>可以</i>是正确的?
6192354999870976 当然。如果我能找到罪犯…
6192354999870977 我们说的是你，孩子们，不是我。
6192354999870978 ...也许不会。
6192354999870975 但是你打算为父亲报仇吗?
6192354999870980 所以你认识我？那很快。如果我有什么困惑的话，我想我应该和你谈谈。
6192354999870981 …我根本没弄清咋回事。
6192354999870979 很好。我们现在知道你是什么样的人了。审判到此结束。你可以走了。
6192354999870983 好的。是的，有时杀人是可以接受的。
6192354999870984 不，谋杀是不可接受的。
6192354999870982 这不是关于这不是关于 <i>我</i>，而是关于 <i>我们 </i>。我的Soul-and-a-Halves总是团结一致。\n回答这个问题。如果需要的话，慢慢来。你很可能选择了我们的命运。
6192354999870986 坏主意。
6192354999870987 我不想伤害你，孩子。
6192354999870985 你这么高……你觉得你能在摔跤中打败我吗？
6192354999870991 等一下。这个利卡到底做了什么？
6192354999870989 别告诉我该怎么做。我可以自己安排行程。
6192354999870990 别那么激动，硬汉。
6192354999870988 什么？你有你的复仇，我们也有。我们现在知道如何处理利卡了，而且这个判决不能上诉。\n 你和我现在的共同点是，今天很快就会结束。去吧。谢谢你的帮助。
6192354999870993 照我说的去做，不要照我做的去做。
6192354999870994 复仇是不可避免的，孩子。我已经在计划我的了。
6192354999870995 对。生活自有惩罚坏人的方法。
6192354999870992 那么，复仇是坏的吗？
6192354999870997 你是说狗？
6192355001697060 这太荒唐的。
6192354999870996 利卡毒死了我们的朋友，他们虚弱而毫无防备。这是一个一目了然的案子。
6192354999871000 同意。所以..？
6192354999871001 他们为什么喊你们叫"Soul-and-a-Halves"?
6192355001697061 狗？…哦，狗！我懂了。所以利卡毒死了你们的宠物？
6192354999870999 我们是Soul-and-a-Halves。对我们来说，他们不仅仅是狗，而是朋友。我们比起人而言更喜欢他们。
6192354999871003 我没有看到猫。
6192354999871004 我就开门见山了。你打算杀了这个利卡？
6192354999871002 除了我们自己的灵魂，我们每个人都有一半。看到这只灰猫在追自己的尾巴吗？那是Jester。我们总是在一起。
6192354999871006 所以，关于这个利卡...
6192354999871005 你当然看不到。他是我的</i> 一半</i> 。Jester 只有在我信任你的时候才会出现在你面前。
6192354999871008 不，是一样的。我知道那个地方。
6192354999871009 啊，是啊……草原上的人们叫它Uur Heelu：“仇恨。”再见，小狗。
6192354999871007 牙龈石！Steppeward from the Basket!你不应该知道这一切吗？或者大草原上的人们对每件事都有不同的名字？
6192354999871011 所以他无法逃避审判。很好。
6192354999871012 那会是哪里呢？
6192354999871010 重要的是他逃到哪里。这点我们知道。
6192354999871014 听着，孩子们。我来处理这事。
6192354999871015 我只是想找个好地方藏身。
6192354999871013 你为什么在意？
6192354999871017 你会使他有戒心的，而我，可以先发制人。
6192354999871018 你吓着我了。我开始怀疑你不是在开玩笑。
6192354999871016 那是从哪里来的？他是我们的问题，不是你的问题。你已经尽了你的职责，剩下的我们就做。
6192354999871020 你会后悔的。
6192354999871021 那就再见了，“老大”。
6192354999871019 为什么紧张，老头？当你告诉我们谋杀是正义的时候，你看起来更强硬了。\n做你自己的事，小布拉克。我们自己解决这个问题。
6192354999871023 那是哪里？
6192354999871024 啊，我知道那个地方。这个小伙子知道他的藏身之处。
6192354999871025 谁是穆克?
6192354999871022 …我们有协议。穆克说是在牙龈石旁。
6192354999871027 怎么会？
6192354999871026 哇，是这样吗？这改变了事情。
6192354999871029 你在说什么…？
6192354999871030 你真的应该好好照顾那灵魂。
6192355001697057 一根骨头…所以受害者是狗？
6192354999871028 所以，你说谋杀是坏的。但你说出来容易。你给了Wolfling 一根骨头。从未喂过Duke。从未见过Lika。我想看看当你遇到叛徒时，你是否会改变你的腔调。\n我敢用灵魂打赌，你会把你说过的话抛诸脑后，折断他的脖子
6192354999871032 你有什么？
6192354999871031 It's fine; I've a Half on top of it, after all.
6192354999871034 你是在测试我吗？
6192354999871035 这是不是有点像某种“污点”？
6192354999871036 然后呢？你会杀了他吗？
6192354999871033 交易如下：具有恻隐之心的你，亲自去见见利卡吧。如果你真的相信一个像他这样奸诈，满嘴谎言的低等生物应该得到自由：那就放他走。\n但是如果你认为他需要被教导一个教训……给他这个皮带。它一定会把他带回来的。
6192354999871038 那就没门。我不做“测试”。
6192354999871039 好的。成交。
6192354999871037 某种程度上。
6192354999871041 那就给你自己找个见多识广的杀手吧。
6192354999871042 好吧，我拿着。
6192354999871040 不，这是个皮带。他会知道这意味着什么。你不会的。
6192354999871044 我不喜欢这样。没门。
6192354999871045 I'll hold you to it.
6192354999871043 当然不是。你不是教过我们谋杀是不对的吗？但我们 <i>会</i>把他送到6英尺以下。
6192354999871047 那时她看见过我了？
6192354999871048 那么，你说的那块石头是什么？
6192354999871046 角落里的那个女孩。她是那个告诉我们你是凶手的人。
6192354999871050 如果他像你说的那么坏，我就把他拖过来。
6192354999871051 然后我像折树枝一样折断他的脖子。
6192354999871052 我想我会打他一顿。
6192354999871053 我一到那里就会弄清一切。
6192354999871049 也许你可以。然后呢？
6192354999871055 当然。
6192354999871056 一条皮带? 为什么？
6192354999871054 你知道吗？把这个皮带给他。他会明白这意味着什么。你愿意为我们做这个吗？
6192354999871058 当然。我也很好奇。
6192354999871059 什么胡扯的玩意。我不会去做的。 
6192354999871057 嗯，他没有受过训练，所以仅仅下达命令是不行的。但这条皮带会起作用的。把它给他。成交？
6192354999871061 好的。我该去哪里？
6192354999871060 她确实看到了。但别打扰她。她很害怕。
6192354999871063 知道了。我很感激你的盛情款待。
6192354999871064 …那么，你想让我来对付那个下毒者吗？
6192354999871062 那就呆在这儿吧。这是避难所。没有大人敢进来。
6192354999871066 我没有看到猫。
6192354999871067 啊，我明白了。所以宠物就像你灵魂的第三部分？
6192354999871065 除了我们自己的灵魂，我们每个人都有一半。看到这只灰猫在追自己的尾巴吗？那是Jester。我们总是在一起。
6192354999871069 我懂了。所以这里还没有人信任我…
6192354999871068 你当然看不到。他是我的</i> 一半</i> 。Jester 只有在我信任你的时候才会出现在你面前。
6192354999871071 不过，回到正轨。你为什么提到报复？
6192354999871070 的确。
6192355001697059 …没什么。你为什么问我复仇的事？
6192355001697058 Who did you think they were?
6192354999871153 什么Jester?
6192354999871154 你对那个男孩做了什么？
6192354999871155 别再唱我的赞歌了。我让你的下毒者走了。
6192354999871156 一个"一半"?
6192354999871152 Jester认为你是个正派的人，而且他不是唯一这么想的。所以，请注意：我们郑重地授予你这条皮带。\n这意味着这里永远欢迎你。甚至有一天你可以得到自己的一半。不是每个人有这项权利。
6192354999871158 Good. So instead, you…?
6192354999871159 I'm not so sure…
6192354999871157 We didn't kill him, as you can see.
6192354999871161 Cool.
6192354999871162 Can I see him?
6192354999871163 So what have you done to Lika?
6192354999871160 My Half. My cat. Called "Jester" because he can rope-walk, stand on his forepaws, and eat raw potatoes.
6192354999871165 I look forward to it.
6192354999871166 Hope springs eternal.
6192354999871167 So what did you do to the boy?
6192354999871164 Not yet. He'll show himself to you when we know you're a good man.
6192354999871169 Folk don't dig pits in the Town. This I know; has something changed?
6192354999871170 You mean six feet deep, don't you?
6192354999871171 "Underground"?! What have you <i>done,</i> punks? Do you… do you even know something, <i>anything</i> about the ground here?
6192354999871168 He took a trip underground. Deep.
6192354999871173 Has someone gone mad…? Where is it?
6192354999871172 Nothing has changed. But there is at least one pit.
6192354999871175 You fools! These are not tales!
6192354999871176 Where is it? Where is the pit?
6192354999871174 Come on, are you serious? Those are old wives' tales…
6192354999871178 Digging wells is forbidden in the Town. So stop trying to fool me.
6192354999871177 Deeper than that.
6192354999871180 Whoever dug it will be <i>very</i> sorry.
6192354999871181 Fair enough. I won't make you snitch. But I'll find the culprit myself.
6192354999871179 …I can't say. I gave my word.
6192354999871183 我让他走了。
6192354999871184 If I am to replace my 父亲: Here ends your first lesson.
6192354999871182 …You let him go?
6192354999871186 You do that. It'll do you good.
6192354999871187 You'll understand why one day, boy.
6192354999871185 …This changes nothing. Keep the leash. But for now, go; I need to think.
6192354999871189 What did you do to the boy?
6192354999871190 I let Lika go.
6192354999871191 Perhaps you'll tame your own dragon when you grow up.
6192354999871188 Half a soul more. A rook, a dog, or maybe a cat… though probably you'd get something huge. A bear, or a bull. We've never had a Half like that before.
6192354999871193 Thank you. I'll have a word with her.
6192354999871194 I'd rather not drag an orphan girl into it. This business is 穆克 enough as it is.
6192354999871192 Now, look. See 穆克? There she broods. She saw you get off the train this morning. Saw as you got attacked. Saw everything.\nBut she doesn't talk much, and I think few grown-ups would believe her. It's better than nothing, though.
6192355000076081 Pills? Is this rat poison or something?
6192355000076084 What makes you think I can do better than that dandy?
6192355000076080 We scrounged up all these pills from all over town. But the big-city doctor said Patches will die if we give him any… His body can't take the strain. \nBut you… You're going to try anyway, aren't you?
6192355000076083 If we can't know what's wrong with him, what can I do? I deal in surgery…
6192355000076087 Let's have a look at Patches.
6192355000076082 He said those are antibiotics. Rambled on about them being old, stale, more harm than good… Said we need to know exactly what's wrong before we can use them. Patches is burning up like a lit match, but there's no knowing why…
6192355000076086 我可以做许多事。
6192355000109295 别烦我，孩子。
6192355000076085 老布拉克会为这件事做点什么的。他用草药找出病人的毛病。他过去常说蓷薾揭示了隐藏在身体里的一切。\n 你能做到吗？
6192355000076094 诊断总是第一件事，榆木脑袋。永远！你不能靠耳朵用药！
6192355000076095 也许我应该锯掉他的一条腿，为了安全起见？
6192355000076093 你也是个医生，不是吗？你可以治愈他。也许你可以切除病原…切除他的阑尾或者其他什么东西。
6192355000109291 他是那么说的？He can get bent.
6192355000109292 And what do <i>you</i> think?
6192355000109293 我想我会去和学者谈谈...关于希波克拉底誓言，如果没有别的话。
6192355000109290 那个大城市的医生也来过这里。告诉我向你传递一个信息：“不要浪在Patches上费时间，他已经完蛋了。相反，振作起来来看我。我有一些对你很重要的东西。”就这样。
6192355001601532 把它们递过来，让我瞅瞅。
6192355001601533 不是每种病都能用药片治好。
6192355001601534 诊断是一个棘手的过程…但我会试试。
6192355001601531 来吧，拿着这些药片。这里，一把，为了一切。只是确保你弄清要给他哪一个，好吗？只有正确的那个可能会有效？
6192355000109297 Hear his steady breathing? He'll live.
6192355000109304 Sadly, the best-laid plans of mice and men oft go badly… as 格里夫 likes to say.
6192355000109305 Too early to say. Time will tell.
6192355000109296 Is he gonna make it?
6192355000109299 I'm afraid so.
6192355000109303 对不起，孩子。我试过了，但还不够。
6192355000109298 \n…他已经离去了?
6192355000109302 Right, he was here. What did he want?
6192355000109300 学者是对的。Patches已经无力回天了。他说这是一种可怕的疾病。没有治愈方法，我们都需要被隔离。\n 也许他想和你谈谈这个。你现在要去见他吗？
6192355000109307 所以他想让我抛弃一个病人，转而和他聊天？好极了。
6192355000109310 我想知道什么事如此紧急...
6192355000109306 那个学者说这没用！我就知道他在撒谎，大城市的骗子。这”不可能的”，那“无可救药”…胡说八道。想让你抛弃我们，去见他谈一些所谓的紧急事务。
6192355000109309 I see. I should pay the man a visit.
6192355000109311 你的帮派现在开始应该待在原地。离街道远点，好吗？
6192355000109308 嗯，他，呃…他告诉我们事情看起来很严峻，你应该放下一切去和他谈谈。\因为，他说，这是一个绝望的情况，我们的地盘必须被隔离。他说你不应该来这里，这样你自己不会患病！
6192355000109333 No, this is one of my own… I have accepted his legacy.
6192355000109334 You're a shifty one, aren't you? You should have more faith in me.
6192355000114851 确保他有足够的水。我去看看学者 想要什么…
6192355001095064 不，我用过你们的“过家家粉”。我不确定它会起作用。
6192355000109332 好吧，他告诉我们这是毫无希望的……我们担心你会相信他，让 Patches死掉。顺便问一下，你给了他什么？你老爸的酊剂？
6192355000593370 No. I failed.
6192355000593369 Is he okay now?
6192355000593372 I couldn't reduce his infection. If I gave him the right pill, that might have delayed it…
6192355000593375 I chose the wrong pill.
6192355000593371 But you gave him the pills! Did they not work?
6192355000593374 You don't know what you're talking about. As long as he lives, a cure can be sought.
6192355000593378 Any delay on the path to death is a victory.
6192355000593373 What use is delaying it?! He'll still die! Only with more suffering…
6192355000593377 Eventually. These things take time.
6192355000593379 If only I could figure out what it was…
6192355000593376 So how do we cure him? When will you know?
6192355001095066 好吧，请原谅我把我能找到的都给了他。那个学者想找我做什么？
6192355001095065 过家家粉？过家家粉？！\n好吧……它<i>会</i>起作用的，.但它只对沙疫有帮助，对其他疾病没有帮助。而且它这很危险。它甚至可以杀死一个你不该杀死的弱小的生物....。
6192355000254877 Tools. Never mind them… Here's what I'd like to know: What business did you have with my 父亲? With Old 布拉克?
6192355000254876 What carry you in all those pockets, 布拉克?
6192355000254881 So you used to go to his home together? All of you? Take a look at this list…
6192355000254879 We… went to his place often. He used to teach us things. Why do you ask?
6192355000254883 他想从你那里得到什么？
6192355000254884 也许你们中有人知道他是怎么死的？你，也许？
6192355000254885 所以你是他的朋友。他有敌人吗？
6192355000254882 有时我们会一起去，有时三三两两……或者单独去。发生了很多事情。不过，你为什么要问？不是我们强迫的；他邀请我们的
6192355000254887 再仔细想想。
6192355000254888 孩子，你在隐瞒什么。但这对我<i>很<i>重要。我说清楚了吗？
6192355000254886 不。
6192355000254890 这个卡佩拉是谁?
6192355000254891 奥吉姆斯基的女儿？为什么是她？
6192355000254889 你知道吗？问卡佩拉。她是我们中年龄最大的，也是最好的解释者。她也是个好人。
6192355000254893 一个…联盟？什么联盟？
6192355000254894 …很好，我去和她谈谈。
6192355000254892 她对我们大家来说就像…一个大姐姐。她组织了一个联盟。
6192355000254896 好。
6192355000254897 很好。嘴巴严实是一种很好的技能。
6192355001065695 她在她家吗，in the Lump?
6192355000254895 别担心。只是一个联盟。15岁以下的人。不管怎样，问她。如果我说得太多，她可能会生我的气。
6192355000254899 Is it a good thing or a bad thing that they're different?
6192355000254900 Good. Don't hold her family against her.
6192355000254898 Fat 维拉德's daughter. But she's not like him at all. She even lives in a separate wing of the house.
6192355001065697 The Station is a discreet place? Trains have become rare indeed…
6192355001065698 I won't stomp around. I'll just take a peek.
6192355001065696 我怎么知道。要么在那里，要么在火车站。只是……如果你去过那里，就不要乱来。这是一个不显眼的地方，不适合成年人去。
6192355000270685 Hush, now. And don't you dare give up! I'll find a cure!
6192355000270686 How long has it been?
6192355000271152 Did you catch it from your friend? What's his name… Patches?
6192355001131751 When did you…? Was it that House of Death thing?
6192355000270684 我完蛋了，医生。别靠近我。我们都知道情况如何。无法逃脱。没有面罩可以救你。别再来了。
6192355000270688 Does it hurt?
6192355000270689 Don't give up, you hear me? There has to be a way!
6192355000270687 Not so long. My bones feel like they've been burning for about an hour.
6192355000270691 We'll carry you wherever you want. We will. Please, calm down.
6192355000270692 We'll find a way to cure you, boy. Let me give you some medicine…
6192355000270690 告诉他们带我离开这里！远离我的朋友。和我们的另一半，傻瓜不会让我走的。\n 让他们隔离我！让他们把我带走！否则每个人都会死！求求你，医生！
6192355000271154 你需要去医院。
6192355000271155 Just don't be afraid. Listen, it's not over yet!
6192355000271153 I suppose. I don't know.
6192355000666999 什么样的房子？
6192355000666998 我们需要找到一所废弃的房子。狗头人，势利小人，只从他们的象牙塔上看到东西……我的 Soul-and-a-Halves 知晓这个小镇的内外。尤其是废弃的房子。
6192355000667001 没。
6192355000667000 死亡之屋。你听说这个故事了吗？蜡烛，黎明，锁着的门？
6192355000667003 Uh huh.
6192355001154570 死亡？鸟？啥玩意？
6192355001154571 So Death is a stay-at-home kind of guy… Huh.
6192355000667002 像昨天和前一天发生的事情…他们从来没有发生过。人死了，是的，但不是这样的。\n 死亡来到了城镇。准确地说，死亡是一只鸟——一只家鸟。所以当他来的时候，他呆在一个废弃的房子里。即使死亡也需要休息的地方。
6192355000667005 But you believe the rest of it?
6192355001154567 What do candles have to do with it?
6192355000667004 死亡在午夜来临。这就是麻烦开始的时候。但是，如果有人在午夜前找到他的房子，那么要么呆在那里直到天亮，要么在里面点蜡烛，他就会停滞不前。\n此外索，你应该会成为不朽……但我不相信最后一部分。
6192355000667007 孩子们，你不应该去那儿。街道很危险。
6192355000667008 我会自己找到那个地方。让我们看看这个故事是否有价值。
6192355000667006 无风不起浪。可汗关于至少在这部分是对的。任何传说都有一点道理。\n 现在就让旧怨见鬼去吧。我和我的童子军今天正在寻找死亡之屋。我们将从粗蔓区开始，我预感到它就在那里。既然你家老头…我的意思是，既然有那么多人死在那里，那就意味那里是死亡安家的地方。
6192355000667010 我自己去找。呆在这里。
6192355000667011 That so? Okay, boy, we'll get there together.
6192355000667012 It's your funeral, boy.
6192355000667009 I'm not going to cower behind another man! And I want to show 可汗 the pedagogue how we do things down here. Let them hide in the Tower. We'll do the work.
6192355001151729 Am I disturbing you?
6192355001151741 Your friend only talks to me through clenched teeth. Perhaps you trust me more?
6192355001601535 I'm sorry I haven't helped, kid. I failed you.
6192355001151728 Fancy meeting you here.
6192355001151743 他是你的朋友吗？
6192355001154559 你们两个在打仗吗？
6192355001154566 他想从你这里得到什么？
6192355001151742 不，我很满足。如你所见，可汗已屈尊向我们寻求帮助。这几乎就像承认他错了。无论我们多么需要，我都不会向他要任何东西。自尊更重要。\n没有他我们也能活下去。他离不开我们。正如他们所说，<i>证毕<i>
6192355001151745 I did help you with that trial of yours, remember?
6192355001151749 你似乎同意我解决有关.....利卡问题的方式，我相信是这个名字吧？
6192355001151750 顺便说一句，我确实发现自己的一半。你能想象它是谁吗？
6192355001195651 I take your business, whatever it is, seriously.
6192355001151744 Perhaps I do.
6192355001154552 信不信由你，这是一只会说话的公牛。
6192355001154553 A boy like you. Very energetic.
6192355001154554 A hamster.
6192355001154551 How should I know?
6192355001154556 All right. What have you here?
6192355001154555 别这样，你不需要说服我。我们相信你，对吧，Jester？Jester相信你。我也是。你对我们诚实，我们向你敞开心扉。诚实是关键。
6192355001154558 Mortal?
6192355001154557 我的敌人
6192355001154561 但是为什么？
6192355001154560 这个词太强了……但打架是会发生的。一切开始时，我们一直战斗到血流干。有很多怨恨。
6192355001154563 我懂了。那是什么使你们两个团结起来的呢？
6192355001154562 因为那座愚蠢的塔。它改变了他们的想法。把梦想变成现实，想象一下。他们对它上瘾了。\n 我们，恰恰相反，根本不需要它。我们有自己的世界，同样完美。我们的Halves和双脚都牢牢地放在地上……我们不想逃避现实。\n 可汗称我们为叛徒。逃兵。他们可以去吹…他们的塔。
6192355001154569 Then why are you to planning to check this bullshit?
6192355001154568 谁在乎？你问的好像你真的相信那狗屎。点上蜡烛，吓走死亡。点亮九根，变成不朽……哈，对了。世界就是这样运作的。6192355001601537 I wanted to help you. I really did. Just… didn't work out.
6192355001601539 所以你仍然相信我？
6192355001601536 Can't be helped now… The big-city dandy said from the start that Patches was doomed. Guess he was right.
6192355000772493 Right on.
6192355001422552 Your friend valued it. What if 可汗 gloated over Jester's death?
6192355001440139 What are you doing here, chief?
6192355000772492 In the end, I'm glad it turned out this way. The Tower was a thorn in the side.
6192355001422554 Good for you.
6192355001422553 Jester cannot die.
6192355001422556 You're not the only one in charge.
6192355001422568 Some people like their dreams. Keep that in mind. Not everyone will follow you, at least not right away.
6192355001422555 Those who spend all their time up high, fall really hard in the end. That's how you get your dream dome smashed to bits. Bad idea! In the end, all dreamers walk the same earth, and I'm in charge of this here earth. Dealing in dreams? Nah, not for me.
6192355001422558 So you accept me into the Soul-and-a-Halves?
6192355001440143 …What's my Half like?
6192355001422557 Of course. There's also you. I really like you! Just look at your Half! It clearly shows your quality of character.\nSo you're with us now, yes?
6192355001422560 Why would you want that?
6192355001422563 No. But you can hang around.
6192355001422559 Will <i>you</i> take <i>me</i> into the Kin?
6192355001422562 We already have warehouses. Why build more?
6192355001422564 And what will you store there?
6192355001422561 I'll build warehouses. Just think about it.
6192355001422566 Ambitious and open-minded. I like it.
6192355001422567 Huh… I thought you were a gang leader, but you're more like a poet.
6192355001425351 If you like me so much, perhaps Jester will finally show himself?
6192355001422565 I'll have a warehouse full of everything. Every miraculous thing. You know? Rarities and oddities.\nCrucially, those'll be <i>things.</i> Material objects, not ethereal reflections of dreams like 可汗's. Things! Get it? Have you ever run your hands over cloth? Smelled walnuts? Seen a piece of carnelian?
6192355001425353 "Cats know the fact of the matter…"
6192355001440147 Fine. I'm a patient man.
6192355001425352 That's up to him.
6192355001440141 Like hell you will.
6192355001440142 She's out of your league, boy. Got a whole herd of Halves, that one.
6192355001440140 I just came to listen. Fiery girl, isn't she? When she's a bit older, I'll definitely lure her into our gang.
6192355001440145 So you're taking me into your gang, huh?
6192355001440146 Holy… Thanks, kid. Now, give me a minute, I need to get all this laughter out of my system.
6192355001440144 It's huge.
6192355001140955 That insane mixture of yours, made from various pills.
6192355001140956 Where does it hurt now?
6192355001140954 It hurts… but it's different now. What did you give me?
6192355001140958 Who else?
6192355001140966 I didn't have anything else to give you. And no time, either.
6192355001140957 A shmowder? Are you nuts? Why did you waste it on me?
6192355001140963 A shmowder.
6192355001140962 In the stomach. It burns. But not the way it did before.\nI was sick with that new disease, I know. What did you give me?
6192355001140965 But you're alive.
6192355001140967 Is this your idea of gratitude?
6192355001140964 They can be… kinda lethal, by the way. If you're weak.
6192355001140969 That's better.
6192355001140970 You're welcome. Although, to be fair, I didn't do much.
6192355001140968 No. Sorry. I mean… Thanks.
6192355001499064 I still can't see him… your familiar.
6192355001526328 Halves can't get infected. Especially cats. It only works with people… 
6192355001499063 I sent Jester away. He kept trying to get close to me, silly cat. I told him to stay in the corner! He could catch it too…
6192355001513966 Remember that trial of yours?
6192355001513971 I'm sorry about Patches, boy. I couldn't figure out what to do with this pest. Got confused. Forgive me.
6192355001513973 You've dragged yourself from the other side once, and you'll do it again. You're a stubborn kid.
6192355001513979 Remember your trial? How you wanted to execute Lika? Some 审判官s…
6192355001591998 Remember how we went to the House of Death? It did protect a district from infection… Turns out you were right.
6192355001513965 I don't feel so good, doctor. Maybe you got a pill or something?\nYou're… a good man. All of us agree. That's what they say, "He's a decent guy, a good guy. His heart's in the right place." But is it, 布拉克?
6192355001513972 I guess he deserved it.
6192355001526333 Well? What well?
6192355001513967 How could we forget. You offered fair judgment back then.\nWe threw Lika in the well… and he deserved it. He poisoned our dogs, so he deserved a dog's death. Earth is the fairest of judges, as our friend Namar likes to say…
6192355001513975 He is. That's why he's sick, too…
6192355001513976 I'm sorry, friend. I'll take care of Jester somehow.
6192355001513985 Stop the drama. You're a fighter. I'll have you up and running in no time.
6192355001592004 可汗 is dead. He got infected—not today, earlier… because of me.
6192355001513974 Well! Lots of things have happened…\nHey, how's 可汗 doing? Tell him I got no grudges… He's a decent guy.
6192355001513978 Are you mad at me?
6192355001513977 Well… it can't be helped now, can it? That big-city asshole got you confused too, remember? But he turned out to be a decent guy too in the end.\nWe all deserve one another.
6192355001513988 
6192355001513987 Patches.
6192355001519912 Hello, chief. How are you? Holding it together?
6192355001526327 Not brilliant, to be honest… you all caught it. But there is some hope.
6192355001519911 Good to see you, 布拉克. How are the rest of our lot…?
6192355001526330 Yeah.
6192355001526331 No.
6192355001526329 I think you could have become one of ours. You're not limited by a single body. Know what I mean?
6192355001526335 为什么？
6192355001526334 In the house where 奥吉姆斯基's son digged one… We knew about it long ago. Our Halves told us. They sneak around everywhere.
6192355001526337 …Let's not talk about it now.
6192355001526338 If only you knew what was beyond that well…
6192355001526336 …Well, he deserved it! We thought we'd leave his punishment up to the Earth.
6192355001592001 Ever.
6192355001592002 If only I followed this rule myself…
6192355001592003 So I'll make sure you live too. Got it?
6192355001592000 We knew what Lika deserved. We'd spare him anyway, I think.\nBut you said the right thing back then. Changed our lives. Killing is never acceptable. Ever.
6192354999910651 诺克金
6192355001258464 诺克金
6192354999871269 ...于是你立刻就相信了。
6192354999871270 谁告诉你的？
6192354999871271 哦，当然！我终于实现了童年的梦想！
6192354999871268 昨天，我听说你杀了你父亲。
6192354999871273 你是个傻逼。
6192354999871274 在那堆狗屎里唯一的事实就是我在他死的那天晚上到的。
6192354999871275 你知道我有多爱他！为什么，你这个傻屌？为何？
6192354999871272 全镇人都相信这点。首先，人们发现他死了。然后，他们得知他是被一个外乡人杀死的。然后他们描述了你。
6192354999871277 我真想打碎你的下巴。
6192354999871278 你现在才知道我不是杀人犯？你的意思是……什么，隐喻？我还管你叫你朋友…
6192354999871276 这和真相不远，布拉克。
6192354999871280 你认为我还得向你证明自己？
6192354999871281 我正在等<i>你的</i>借口，和道歉——虽然我可能不接受。
6192355001534951 我日...你把头剃了。准备当和尚？还是一个士兵？
6192354999871279 你为什么来？终于想到了一些好的借口？
6192354999871283 斯塔克, 你脑袋有问题吗？
6192354999871282 最好的防御形式是进攻。你总是做得很好。
6192354999871285 这个镇上住多少人，白痴？但你仍然指出我是罪魁祸首！
6192354999871284 这不仅仅是场死亡，他是被谋杀的。 
6192354999871287 ...那不是真的。
6192354999871288 你疯了吗, 鲁宾?
6192354999871289 深呼吸，冷静，解释。什么危险？你知道什么？
6192354999871286 你背叛了他。他最需要你的时候你就走了。他大声呼救你，但你不在乎。他很危险，而你却在别的地方忙碌。他真的 <i>相信</i>，你的到来会结束他的麻烦。\n 不过，一如既往，他是对的。
6192354999871291 像你？
6192354999871292 劳拉是对的。你 <i>就是个</i> 孬逼。
6192354999871293 已经在考虑遗产了，嗯？我们中的一些人仍然悲伤。
6192354999871290 劳拉说我很蠢，丧失了理性。但我没有！\n 你的父亲总是教我们了解情况，布拉克。了解大局？这里不需要你。别为你父亲的遗产操心。他有更好的继承人。6192354999871295 Including the night he was murdered?
6192354999871296 我真<i>想</i> 扁你。
6192354999871297 这是他的信。我唯一收到的。看这里，白痴—他提到一个威胁。可能是什么？
6192354999871294 为什么不呢？我是他的学生。你用他的信擦屁股的时候，我保留了他的知识。我一直在他身边。
6192354999871299 <i>他</i> 送我走的，王八蛋！他希望我在别处学习！ 
6192354999871298 闭嘴。你父亲的遗物是他的 <i>工作</i>。那是他的遗产！你完全不值得拥有它。他的工作不是你的。他的知识不是你的。你两个都放弃了。
6192354999871301 可怜的斯塔克。你知道，我现在都不想揍你了。
6192354999871302 你太歇斯底里了，伙计。你完全不讲道理。
6192354999871303 我哪都不去。你应该听格拉薇尔的。你行事愚蠢。
6192354999871300 那就去别处吧。学你在那里能学到的一切。\n这里没有你呆的地方。如果金族人告诉你放下他的重担，听我说——即使是渣滓有时也可能是对的。你无法驾驭。6192354999871305 I only got a single letter. Two, maybe three weeks ago!
6192354999871306 有场战争，混蛋。你认为火车经常来这个镇吗？
6192354999871304 …不，他不会告诉我的。他建议我们等你来。但你并不着急，是吗？他的第一封信是在五月寄的！
6192354999871308 谁在调查这起谋杀案？没有人！但你所关心的只是一些“继承”。而你 <i>胆敢</i> t指责我。告诉我你知道什么！
6192354999871307 他的遗产不是什么 <i>东西</i>！它是不同的。你别想指责我！至于你，格拉薇尔,，别插手。
6192354999871310 这才是最重点，二逼。不是遗产！
6192354999871309 我知道他被谋杀了。被他认识的人，他信任的人所杀。一个可以轻易进入他的房子的人！
6192354999871312 那么你 <i>知道</i> 些什么？某位学生...
6192354999871311 ...不。
6192355001525157 你脑子有问题吗？
6192355001525158 我日...你把头剃了。准备当和尚？还是一个士兵？
6192355001525156 她把我拖到这里。说你无罪。但你有罪！
6192355000021066 让你来处理？世界上为什么…？
6192355000021067 我比你更清楚父亲想要什么。
6192355000021068 重要的是我想要什么。 Leave 父亲 alone, 斯塔克.
6192355000021065 我知道你在想什么。你想找凶手，为你父亲报仇，把它找出来。\n忘了吧，让我来处理。我会比你做得更好的。父亲希望你工作，而不是报仇。代替他工作。
6192355000021070 这对我意味着什么？
6192355000021071 我<i>真的非常想</i> 揍你，鲁宾.
6192355000021074 不。
6192355000021069 你辜负了他。你犹豫了一下，让他陷入困境。依我看，你丧失了复仇的权利。交给我吧。我可以做得更好。你……嗯，你作为医生比我好。
6192355000021073 少在那给我逼逼， 斯塔克.
6192355000021075 我会做我的职责需要我做的事。明白了吗？
6192355000021072 你不再是一个外科医生。你是一个药剂师。我擅长解剖人——从各种角度，布拉克。但要想创造一种草药，就像伊西多做的那样……那需要你的直觉。你的手。承认这一切我并不高兴，但这是真的。
6192355001097765 我不认为现在有时间聚在一起。
6192355001097766 I got the idea before… all this.
6192355001097767 这么生气干嘛？是的，我本来打算把你们都召集起来。但没有人强迫任何人。
6192355001097764 看看谁来了……劳拉说，你在计划一个感伤的聚会？记得过去的美好时光吗？好像六年没有过去？
6192355001097769 Drop that sarcasm, will you?
6192355001097770 Is it an either-or thing for you? Work doesn't have to interfere with friendship.
6192355001097771 Are you planning to work days <i>and</i> nights? Right…
6192355001097768 Well, I guess the sentimental bout with old friends is cancelled. Time to work.
6192355000031152 You're a quick one, though.
6192355000033651 That's why I came. What do you need me to do?
6192355000033652 I have my own work to do.
6192355000031151 Where have you been? We're drowning in work.
6192355000033658 父亲 knew how to make… concoctions. He mixed tissue with twyre infusions.
6192355000033667 Nothing yet.
6192355000033668 No, you're right. We need to observe the sick, work with the dead. There's no other way.
6192355000033657 All right, genius, tell me. What's on your mind?
6192355000033660 What do you do here?
6192355000033665 I had more urgent business.
6192355000033659 You're a slow one.
6192355000033662 Is that it?
6192355000033663 Exactly. So shouldn't we be making medicine?
6192355000033664 Autopsies? Teach the butchers. Dirty care… Important work, sure. But is that really the best use for my hands?
6192355000033661 If the screams are any indication, the sand plague is painful. These people need care. Dirty care. Prosecting the dead, studying infected organs… 丹考夫斯基's orders.\nWhat else can be done? We try different older medicines, study their effects. But the supply is short…
6192355000033670 So you're an optimist.
6192355000033682 Fewer than that. We need to find another way.
6192355000033683 How do you know?
6192355000033669 Damn it, there's no time. It spreads fast, and kills quicker. I doubt it'll take a week to destroy everyone in the Town. If quarantines hold, ten days at best.
6192355000033673 So we'll have to rely on my talent.
6192355000033674 Who knows… Perhaps I did.
6192355000033675 I should have accepted the inheritance.
6192355000033671 Your 父亲 knew many things, true. But he didn't even have time to teach me, even though I was by his side all those years, sleeping on his floor like a dog. I tried my best, but this work requires a certain talent. Like his.\nAnd you? You learned nothing from him.
6192355000033677 He failed. I won't.
6192355000033678 So I will have to become him, then. Who else, after all.
6192355000033681 Then shouldn't we give up? Just try to survive and hope for the best.
6192355000033676 I was with him in the First Outbreak. I know the sand plague. I'm no mystic, but… it's some punishment from heaven. More complex than disease.\nTo cure such an ill, one must <i>be</i> 伊西多. But even he failed.
6192355000033680 父亲 always said we should look for connections among things. That is how he made those mixtures.
6192355000033684 It's all about mixtures, 鲁宾. The right mixtures of the right components.
6192355000033685 I'll follow the Lines. That's what makes me different from you.
6192355000033679 Blah blah! Empty words. Why are you always so arrogant? It always got under my skin.
6192355000033687 <i>You're</i> an idiot.
6192355000033688 I agree. But I'm a stubborn idiot.
6192355000033686 You're an idiot.
6192355000033690 You're a broken record. Just trust me, like you once did. If you can.
6192355000033691 We'll see.
6192355000033692 You, on the other hand, have turned into his shadow. How does that help? Go on, wipe the foreheads of the ill. I can't listen to their screaming.
6192355000033689 You would need to become a teacher to accomplish that, but you chose to split away from your 父亲. You're no 伊西多, Cub.
6192355000839392 I'll drop by, but I won't confine myself here. I have another plan.
6192355000839393 We need to make medicine. And I can't do that here.
6192355000839391 Any suggestions?\nIn any case, this is now a hospital. Your place is here. Be so kind as to stay and do your job.
6192355000276274 斯塔克, take a look at this sigil. It's called "udurgh." Ever heard of that?
6192355000276275 Nothing. Just passing through.
6192355000276273 Yes?
6192355000276277 So no love for our kind. 为什么？
6192355000276278 You've never come across the word? "Udurgh." Think for a moment… Maybe my 父亲 mentioned it?
6192355001647069 Perhaps it would be smart of you to take some interest? Seeing how they're taking interest in your hide.
6192355000276276 More Kin nonsense? They mark bulls with this. What does it matter? I have no interest in their stupid cattle brands.
6192355000276280 Big words.
6192355000276281 My 父亲 and I, we're also of the steppe. Did you somehow forget?
6192355000276279 Your 父亲 wasted too much effort on that rabble.
6192355000276283 Someone has a temper. Is this personal?
6192355000276286 "They," huh? Not "you"? So you think I'm a different breed?
6192355000276287 You sound jealous. Or maybe…?
6192355000276282 They distracted him from his work. Wanted him to live for them, toil for them, tend to them!\nAll they need is an owner. A protector. A caretaker. Someone to cling to, like fleas, draining their blood. They're all about blood.
6192355000276285 What, you? What reason could they possibly have?
6192355000276293 Might be the Kin, might not.
6192355000276284 Wolves! Wolves, each and every one of them! They surround you, smother you, they wait till you're out of breath, then they press on, and on, and on.\nThey put him into an early grave, the blasted Kin, and I'm soon to follow.
6192355000276289 I'm working right now, 斯塔克. Figuring this out is my job, too.
6192355000276291 Folklore… There's an idea. Doesn't 奥吉姆斯基's son record steppe folklore?
6192355000276292 You need more sleep, friend.
6192355000276288 Well, maybe I gave them a reason. Or maybe it's habit for them by now.\nLook. Take your damn sigil and get lost. You picked a curious time to study folklore. You need work, or what? Let me know, and I'll make you busy.
6192355000772158 Joking? Good. Keep it up.
6192355001430994 We'll get to that tomorrow. Today, let's rest.
6192355001430995 I command you to never call me that again.
6192355000772157 Waiting for your command, my Mentor.
6192355001430997 Come on, drop it.
6192355001430998 Are you all right, 斯塔克? Angry with me again?
6192355001430996 I humbly accept your every word, oh wisest of the wise, and obey.
6192355001431000 Depends on how you look at it.
6192355001431001 We're alive. Isn't that enough?
6192355001431002 You're right. There's nothing to celebrate.
6192355001430999 Well, is there something to celebrate that I've missed?
6192355001431004 I stand by my choice.
6192355001431005 Do you even believe yourself?
6192355001431006 You're right, I shouldn't have. What good is your moping? A doctor should be lively. They must inspire confidence. That's what 父亲 used to say.
6192355001431003 …You shouldn't have stopped me.
6192355001431008 Let's wait and see. Time heals all wounds.
6192355001431009 Don't give up on yourself. It's not over for you yet.
6192355001431010 Let your work be the judge of that.
6192355001431007 …Or maybe you did right.
6192355001431012 …Thank you. I wanted to.
6192355001431013 No. I'm different.
6192355001431014 You're the one who resembles him, not me. Believe it or not, that's why I asked you to… well, to stay with me.
6192355001431011 …You turned out just like your 父亲, in the end. You even talk the same.
6192355000833111 What can I do right now?
6192355000839394 What consequences?
6192355000833110 If you really plan to make that panacea of yours, do what you think is right. I'll cover for you.\nBut the order from the 城镇大厅 was clear: All doctors are to work at the hospital, sharing their duties.\nYou are to report daily—and <i>work.</i> Or else there will be consequences.
6192355000839396 I'm not trying to slack off.
6192355000839397 I thought we already discussed my current duties.
6192355000839395 You'll be removed from the Pest Fund lists and receive no monetary support.\nIn my book, Cub, it's not about the money, but a clear conscience. Your duties as a doctor.
6192355000839399 What about medicine? Is the hospital not supplied?
6192355000839402 I can.
6192355001702152 I doubt it. That knowledge is taboo. But I can find more morphine in the streets.
6192355000839398 We're short on 止痛药s. Can you brew more?
6192355000839401 I'll try.
6192355000839403 I'm low on resources myself.
6192355000839400 Where would we take it from? Medicine stores? All stocks are running low, since the train wasn't here on time.\nThey'll requisition what they can. 丹考夫斯基 is in charge of that. But we need more right now.
6192355000839407 Listen. Was there really not a single recovery?
6192355000839405 Yeah…
6192355000839406 All right. I'll have a look at the patients.
6192355000839404 I'm… at a loss. I've never seen a serious outbreak. And this…
6192355000839409 Huh...
6192355000839410 Pneumonic plague. There was no salvation either. And no vaccines helped.
6192355000839408 Not a single one. Neither was there one five years ago. I don't know of any other such disease.
6192355000839412 An oak isn't felled in one stroke.
6192355000839413 It's not a panacea! Where did you even get that word?
6192355000839416 Look, I really think you're being unfair to 格里夫.
6192355000839411 So how's your panacea going?
6192355000839415 How long does it take for the sand pest to kill a patient?
6192355000839435 Where are they buried?
6192355000839414 …Too many corpses today. More than yesterday. They can barely cart them all away.
6192355000839418 And antibiotics? Properly prescribed, they can extend their life…
6192355000839417 No one stayed alive for more than a day. If the patient has a weak constitution, or no medicine, it takes closer to eight hours.
6192355000839420 Didn't take you long to forget your friend.
6192355000839423 He helped you, hasn't he? With whatever it is you're doing in the Warehouses.
6192355000839419 Ugh.
6192355000839422 Bandit is too impressive a title. They're petty criminals.
6192355000839426 Why not?
6192355000839421 I do not deny our old friendship. But I don't want to see him, not anymore—nor do I want to patch up his bandits.
6192355000839425 I don't think those are his men.
6192355000839427 He has no control over them. He admitted that himself.
6192355000839424 Who drew knives? Who attacked people at night? His thugs! He cuts them loose! The man giving the orders deserves the blame.
6192355000839429 Whatever.
6192355000839430 You don't believe him, you don't believe me. Do you even believe yourself?
6192355000839428 I don't believe that.
6192355000839432 Yes.
6192355000839436 The three Layers.
6192355000839431 I remember Mentor talking about it. I always forget your steppe word… the three states? Is that what you mean?
6192355000839434 Is that my job for today?
6192355000839440 So you do believe I can do it, after all?
6192355000839433 Could you at least find the right antibiotics for some patients here? Perhaps some would survive a day or two. Then you could rescue them with that panacea of yours.
6192355000839438 All right. Consider it done.
6192355000839439 I'll need to brew the antibiotics first, or buy them… It'll take time.
6192355000839437 I guess.
6192355000839442 So there are still no recoveries?
6192355000839441 I don't know. Ask 丹考夫斯基. He manages it all. I just do my job.
6192355000839449 You want to try yourself?
6192355000839450 Yes, more or less.
6192355000839448 So how's it made? Get blood with antibodies, mix with a 酊剂?
6192355000844752 Where would you go?
6192355000844755 Me too. Perhaps we should go together?
6192355000844751 …I've made up my mind, you know. If I survive all this, I leave.\nNever to return.
6192355000844754 Very funny.
6192355000844756 I guess it's safer than here.
6192355000844753 I don't know. To the front.
6192355001647068 So?
6192355001647067 He has.
6192355000839444 What's today's job?
6192355000839445 Stay strong. I think I'm making progress.
6192355001224628 Why are the Kin after you? Tell me.
6192355001715051 And you… so you got out of trouble on your own?
6192355000839443 Ah, there you are…
6192355000839447 What do you mean?
6192355000840553 I can see that. You look exhausted, 斯塔克. You need some rest.
6192355000839446 I haven't been wasting time, either.
6192355000840556 How many is "a lot"?
6192355000840567 What an opportunity for practice, 斯塔克! No one would blacklist you, either.
6192355000840554 Today's job is downright ugly. Perfect for the likes of you and I. Autopsies—a lot of them.
6192355000840558 Are you hiding something?
6192355000840557 Never mind.
6192355000840560 I hope it will all come to fruition soon.
6192355000840561 Very substantial.
6192355000840562 I'd rather not guess. But you'll be the first to know when I succeed.
6192355000840559 Substantial?
6192355000840564 What exactly will be studied?
6192355000840566 Examining infected organs makes sense, but why would we need healthy ones?
6192355000840563 We need organs—to study them. Infected, healthy… all kinds of them. Not blood, though. Orderlies can collect it without our help.\nI'll do most of the work, but that's no reason for you to slack off.
6192355000840569 I'll help you out. Autopsies, huh?
6192355000840568 I guess… but I just don't have the energy anymore for all this.
6192355000840571 But how? We don't have a clinical picture. We know nothing!
6192355000840570 The disease mutates. The clinical picture changes. They all have different symptoms…\nWe're no longer sure which organs become damaged first. So we'll have to figure it out.
6192355000840573 Oh, so this is all his idea? I see.
6192355000840574 You seem less like an adoring fan. That's nice to see.
6192355000840572 Leave that to 丹考夫斯基. Our job is to extract the organs and put them in the ice box—there, on the stage. Let 丹考夫斯基 be the one to rummage through them.
6192355000840576 If he's making the same progress I am, there's still hope.
6192355000840577 …Are you implying the same about me, I wonder?
6192355000840575 He works hard, but I've yet to see the results.
6192355000840579 Peace, then?
6192355000840578 You know I never imply. I tell things straight.\nAnd… I shouldn't have said the things I said back then. Mentor would be proud of you now. He <i>was</i> proud of you.
6192355000840581 Let bygones be bygones.
6192355000840582 All's well that ends well.
6192355000840580 Peace.
6192355001224630 Got it. So what do we have here? What work needs to be done?
6192355001647076 That look on your face... I don't like it.
6192355001224629 Not here. It's a long story, and this place is… well, unsuitable. If you really want to talk about it, come by my place tonight. Or tomorrow.
6192355001647078 You're right. Everything is connected in a body; all three Layers.
6192355001647079 I doubt we're capable of examining anything at this level without a real lab…
6192355001647080 I haven't graduated.
6192355001647077 Did those six years of study go over your head completely? "Infected" and "healthy" are just words. But everything is interconnected in a body.\nA healthy organ might be showing first signs of infection. Conversely, it might already have developed antibodies…
6192355001715053 So you don’t need me all that much, after all.
6192355001715054 I’m glad.
6192355001715055 I’m sorry I couldn’t help…
6192355001715052 I have. As you know, I’m good at cutting.
6192355001715057 I think so.
6192355001715058 What’s our job for today?
6192355001715059 Is this resignation I hear? I don’t like your tone.
6192355001715056 Forget me, Cub. Do your thing. Save the Town. Work. How’s the panacea going? Any progress?
6192355001715061 Why do you always have to be so difficult!
6192355001715062 So what’s our job for today?
6192355001715060 Tough luck.
6192355000844758 How are you, friend? Completely exhausted, huh?
6192355000844759 That's all right. Have some sleep.
6192355000844757 [he's not dead, only sleeping]
6192355000844761 Remember that time at the Scruff, when we had that fight? You said you're bound to this land. That you'd been born here, and will die here. That you didn't want me to leave… That's when it all went downhill between us, wasn't it?
6192355000844764 Can you hear me?
6192355000844760 …………..
6192355000844763 See how it turned out? I'm back, but you seem to be leaving. 父亲 was the only thing that kept you anchored, wasn't he? You were loyal to the land because of him. Now, you're all alone. So you're running to death's embrace. Anywhere, away from here.
6192355001583895 See how it turned out? I came back, but you… seem to be leaving.
6192355000844768 Well, you don't have to answer.
6192355000844762 ……
6192355000844766 You could… stay. 父亲's gone, but perhaps someone could take his place in your heart. Maybe you could marry 劳拉. Become a 父亲 yourself. Things would turn around…
6192355000844767 All right, sleep some more. I'll stop pestering you.
6192355001658562 You could… stay. 父亲's gone, but perhaps someone could take his place in your heart. Maybe you could become a 父亲 yourself. Things would turn around…
6192355000844765 ……
6192355001241465 I wonder what you've gotten yourself into, pal. Who did you dissect? You're so secretive, as though it was 西蒙's body! Heh. Now <i>that</i> would be a whole heap of trouble…
6192355001241471 What have you done to annoy the Kin so much? Robbed a grave? Whom did you take from them to provoke this hunt?
6192355001583894 Seems like you had a lot on your plate recently… and I don't even know what it was about.
6192355001241464 ……
6192355001241467 All I know is that you couldn't have done anything low or selfish. I guess you tried to make a cure, too? A vaccine, or a serum? But why did you have to do it alone? Even I can't do everything on my own, and you…
6192355001241472 Then again, it hardly matters now.
6192355001241475 Brilliant. I've waited so long to have an honest, heartfelt conversation with you, and now this. Oh 斯塔克, why must you always be so difficult?
6192355001241466 ……
6192355001099162 Why are you here?
6192355001100676 I'm overjoyed to see you too.
6192355001099161 Well?
6192355001099752 What kind of work can you possibly be doing at this place?
6192355001099753 Moonlighting as an architect? Or a philosopher, perhaps?
6192355001099751 Work.
6192355001099755 I didn't. How was I to know?
6192355001100677 You're a… what? Where did you even learn that?
6192355001099754 I'll have you know this house is in mourning, too. 西蒙 凯恩 died the same night as my mentor. And I am a pathoanatomist, if you didn't know. It's my main area of expertise.
6192355001100679 What for?
6192355001100678 Your 父亲. And I'd obviously prefer if the Kin didn't know that. They've had it for me for a while now.
6192355001100681 The hell? Was it stolen? By whom? And what for?
6192355001100682 Whoa… You're in big trouble, friend.
6192355001100683 Maybe the two of us should go looking for it.
6192355001100680 Forget it. Are you here about 西蒙's body as well? You're a bit late—I performed the autopsy on the same day. And on the next day the body went missing.
6192355001100685 Anyway, I actually came here looking for you.
6192355001100688 Then why are you here?
6192355001100684 I've already convinced the Judge that it wasn't my fault. I am, after all, a pathoanatomist, not a guard. \nThe 凯恩s have enough people. They'll find it. So it's not our problem anymore.
6192355001100687 We want to gather this evening. At the old place.
6192355001100686 为什么？
6192355001100690 Got it. By the way, I came here looking for you.
6192355001100689 玛利亚, the 凯恩s' daughter, wanted to talk. And when she wants something, you don't argue. She took after 妮娜, if you know what I mean. 玛利亚 probably wants to discuss 西蒙… So here I wait.
6192355001100692 Yes, by the Basket.
6192355001100691 By the Basket?
6192355001100694 Yes. He is.
6192355001100695 We'll see who comes.
6192355001100696 Why do you have to be so cranky? Go swim in the Gorkhon! Perhaps it'll cool your head!
6192355001100693 Touching. 坏格里夫 included?
6192355001100698 Why do you care? See you. Good luck with 凯恩娜.
6192355001100699 Yes, it was 劳拉's.
6192355001100700 格里夫 is the one who's truly hurt. It was ugly of you two to turn away from him.
6192355001100701 No, 斯塔克. It was mine.
6192355001100697 Heard you loud and clear. And now excuse me, but I need to prepare for a tough conversation.\nJust… wait a second. Tell me: Reconciling everyone was, of course, 劳拉's idea?
6192355001099164 I didn't expect you to come.
6192355001103287 Go, 斯塔克. Go. Make us all feel ashamed.
6192355001099163 I think I should go. I've a lot of work to do.
6192355001103264 What's that train car over there? I don't remember it before.
6192355001103281 So you don't venture into the steppe often?
6192355001103263 Neither did I. But I don't regret it. I've regained my strength a bit. This place… It's good. I've already forgotten what the steppe is like.
6192355001103266 You've got a keen eye, noticing a ball in this dark.
6192355001103267 Not everyone fits? You mean they're filtering someone out?
6192355001103265 Damned if I know… I think someone lives there. A kid, maybe. I saw a ball there in the rails. Kids often gather around these parts. Not everyone is fond of that Polyhedron. Not everyone fits there.
6192355001103269 Even when you were one yourself.
6192355001103270 Same here.
6192355001103268 I don't know. I've no idea how to deal with children. Never had.
6192355001103272 …Looking the wrong way, unfortunately.
6192355001103271 Why yes, I can't complain. I do have a good eye.
6192355001103274 You said the Kin were after you. Do they have a good reason?
6192355001103280 It's not anger, pal. It's jealousy. Let go of it, will you? It's ridiculous.
6192355001103273 …Ugh. Forget it. Enough idle chatter. Yes, I am angry with you. And you ought to understand why.
6192355001103277 But how did 父亲 allow it?
6192355001103276 Oh… I'm beginning to understand now.
6192355001103289 So you dig up dead Khatanghe from down below? Not a brilliant move…
6192355001103275 Your kind doesn't take kindly to cutting bodies. And cutting bodies is my job.\nMy mentor… I mean, your 父亲… You know what he meant for the Kin. He did have that right, kind of, but still… I was the one they demonized. And that's fine. I don't mind.
6192355001103279 You truly were a loyal apprentice to him.
6192355001103288 Fine. It's not my place to judge you. And neither is it yours to judge me.
6192355001103278 And who would herd your kind, otherwise? Fat 维拉德? Your elders?\nHe had a hard job. And he did operate, when he absolutely had to. But bodies require autopsy. You know it as well as I. Pathoanatomy is the foundation of our art. A science.
6192355001103283 Huh. I don't remember you ever being afraid of anyone that much.
6192355001103284 So you see me as part of the Kin, now? Does that make it easier to hate me?
6192355001103282 I'm unwelcome here. Your kind is better left alone. They don't appreciate my company.
6192355001103286 What do you mean?
6192355001103285 You know… Perhaps you're right. You're anything but stupid, Cub. You've always been a good judge of character. For all the good that's done anyone…
6192355001171352 Followed my heart.
6192355001171353 Everything's covered in blood. Hey, why is that?
6192355001171354 The lamp by the door, you grand conspirator.
6192355001171351 How did you find me?
6192355001171356 What is that behind the curtains? Is it… shining?
6192355001171357 Wrong question. What are <i>you</i> doing here?
6192355001171358 坏格里夫 didn't give you away. Well, he tried not to, at least.
6192355001171355 So 坏格里夫 yapped, then? I'd throttle him with his own loose tongue, if I could.\nWhat are you doing here?
6192355001171360 Time for what?
6192355001171361 What are you afraid of? Who are you butchering here?
6192355001171359 Who cares now. If you've found me, others will, too. And I'm short on time!
6192355001171363 斯塔克. You're making medicine too, aren't you? Answer me!
6192355001171364 Come on, tell me. We must work together!
6192355001171362 I can't say anything right now. You don't want to know, anyway. Ignorance is bliss. Just trust me when I say it's important. Very important, Cub.
6192355001171366 Buy from whom? Who are you hiding from?
6192355001171365 Listen. I won't tell you anything until I'm done. Too many people would be let down. <i>The</i> person would…\nIf you want to know so badly, buy me some time to finish what I started!
6192355001171368 What have you done to them? Stolen something?
6192355001171369 斯塔克… You told me you have no idea what an "udurgh" is. What are you hiding behind those sheets?
6192355001171370 I know it's the Kin. But 为什么？
6192355001171367 Your Kin are after me. Surrounding me like wolves. They haven't attacked yet, but soon will. Perhaps they're already here. Never far from you…
6192355001171372 Handle them how?
6192355001171371 It's a long story. Will you stop asking?! Just lend me a hand! Scout the area around the warehouse. I suspect the steppe people wait for me…\nAnd if they have found me, well… Handle them.
6192355001171374 Fine, to hell with you. Keep working.
6192355001171375 All right, I'll scout the area. Please hide better. Put the lamp out.
6192355001171376 I'll visit tomorrow night. I'll knock—our secret knock. I expect details.
6192355001171373 I don't know. However you can. Don't let them find me. They can sense where I am… I know their breed! They're getting close. I need more time! Just one more day! Or two… Maybe.
6192355001171378 Where is… whatever you worked with yesterday?
6192355001171379 You're finished with… what? Those people outside, what do they want?
6192355001171380 You're talking about death. Like hell, friend. Too early. You need sleep.
6192355001171377 I know, I know. There's a swarm of vultures outside. Drawing closer, closer. That's all right. What matters is, I'm finished. I can rest now…
6192355001171382 You promised to tell me what you were doing.
6192355001171383 What was it, 斯塔克? Was it human? Was it… the Eighth on my list?
6192355001171381 It's depleted.
6192355001171385 What was it made of?
6192355001171386 What did you want to make?
6192355001171387 So you worked on a serum! Without me! Small wonder you failed. But 为什么？
6192355001171384 I helped 丹考夫斯基 make a vaccine. My product is not what he wanted; it only provides temporary protection. But it's better than nothing.\nIt's not what <i>I</i> wanted, either… but I won't throw in the towel.
6192355001171389 About your survival. Do you plan to just sit here and wait until they break in?
6192355001171390 What do these people want? They're from the Kin. Did you wrong them?
6192355001171388 I'll tell you later, if I survive to tell the tale.
6192355001171392 Yes. I can do that.
6192355001171393 No. You've done something suspicious, something bad. I won't help you until I know more.
6192355001171391 All I want now is a good night's sleep… A few hours would do… I need to change hideouts. Nothing's keeping me here anymore.\nCan you distract them? Lead them away?
6192355001171395 Small wonder.
6192355001171396 That's fine. It's not the first time. All right, be ready to run.
6192355001171397 I'm not sure I'll manage. I'm on my last legs myself.
6192355001171394 I just need a few minutes to slip away. And then you run away, too, or give up. They want me, not you. They take you as one of their own. I don't want to hide behind you, but I can barely stay on my feet…
6192355001171399 Just tell me what you did.
6192355001171400 Tell me what you were working on, at least!
6192355001171398 What Eighth? What list? What are you talking about?
6192355001171402 Sounds just like you.
6192355001171403 And now what? Do you plan to confess?
6192355001171404 Don't you dare confess. Or we'll have one less doctor.
6192355001171401 I committed a crime in their spirit. A butcher crime. They were accused, so, many were murdered. I didn't come forward. I needed to finish the job.
6192355001171406 All right, I'll help you out. Like I always do. Have it your way.
6192355001171407 I wouldn't beat a whole crowd, anyway.
6192355001171405 For now, I can't. Do as you will.
6192355001224383 Where is… whatever you worked with yesterday?
6192355001224385 You're talking about death. Like hell, friend. Too early. You need sleep.
6192355001224413 Nope. They're finished. Where there was a swarm, now there is no one.
6192355001224382 I know, I know. There's a swarm of vultures outside. Drawing closer, closer. That's all right. What matters is, I'm finished. I can rest now…
6192355001224387 You promised to tell me what you were doing.
6192355001224388 What was it, 斯塔克? Was it human? Was it… the Eighth on my list?
6192355001224386 It's depleted.
6192355001224390 What was it made of?
6192355001224391 What did you want to make?
6192355001224392 So you worked on a serum! Without me! Small wonder you failed. But 为什么？
6192355001224389 I helped 丹考夫斯基 make a vaccine. My product is not what he wanted; it only provides temporary protection. But it's better than nothing.\nIt's not what <i>I</i> wanted, either… but I won't throw in the towel.
6192355001224394 Please be so kind as to survive.
6192355001224419 Noted.
6192355001224393 I'll tell you later, if I survive to tell the tale.
6192355001224417 How about hitting the cot right here? I can work your shift in the hospital tomorrow.
6192355001224418 A few days, you wanted to say.
6192355001224396 All I want now is a good night's sleep… A few hours would do…
6192355001224404 Just tell me what you did.
6192355001224405 Tell me what you were working on, at least!
6192355001224403 What Eighth? What list? What are you talking about?
6192355001224415 Well… Sort of.
6192355001224416 I just asked very nicely, and they went home.
6192355001224414 Did you… fix their vital signs, sawbones?
6192355001411580 Leaving…? With the Army?
6192355001411585 Where are you going?
6192355001411579 There you are… It's good to have a chance to say my goodbyes. I'm leaving. Remember me fondly, Cub.
6192355001411582 To war?
6192355001411581 With the Army.
6192355001411584 Are you mad?
6192355001411588 Got a death wish?
6192355001411583 To war.
6192355001411587 Will you at least tell me what you did?
6192355001411595 I have something else in mind for you.
6192355001411586 You're surprised? I've always wanted this. I'm made for the military.\nWhere else would I go? I've done enough here for people to avoid looking at me wherever we meet. Elsewhere, it'll be easier to forget.
6192355001411590 You idiot!
6192355001411598 What if I offered you another life?
6192355001411589 Maybe I do.
6192355001411592 So that's your decision… and it's final?
6192355001421251 To hell with secrets. But you do have a place in this town.
6192355001411591 No. The secret's not mine alone. I'd betray someone else's trust.
6192355001411594 <i>Absolutely</i> final?
6192355001411593 It is.
6192355001411597 Not really… Except that I do respect your decision. You're a free man—free to do what you think is right. Goodbye, 斯塔克.
6192355001411599 I need an assistant.
6192355001411600 What if you became my student? I'll mold you into a decent doctor in less than three years. Finish what 父亲 started.
6192355001411596 You have something to say on the matter?
6192355001411602 It's a sign of respect!
6192355001411603 You're just… dear to me, that's all.
6192355001411604 Don't you think this is your duty?
6192355001411601 Do you disrespect me <i>that</i> much?
6192355001411606 So what do you say?
6192355001411607 Do you need some time to think?
6192355001411605 …You surprised me.
6192355001411609 So that you can take mine.
6192355001411610 I need you, 斯塔克.
6192355001411611 The Town needs you. I… can't do everything on my own.
6192355001411608 You've truly taken his place. Your 父亲's, I mean.
6192355001411613 To send him to hell, hopefully.
6192355001411614 See you around, 斯塔克.
6192355001411612 Fine. I agree. Now go; I need to wait for the 士官.
6192354999900651 斯塔克·鲁宾
6192355001258466 斯塔克·鲁宾
6192354999871344 我是阿泰米·布拉克.
6192354999871345 不， <i>我</i> 听着呢。我父亲的遗体呢？
6192354999871343 我听着呢，
6192354999871347 弑父者？你疯了吗？ 
6192354999871348 来啊，如果非得这么做的话，但是给我听好了！
6192354999871349 我不会忘记这个的。
6192354999871346 啊，弑父者。你省去了我追捕你的麻烦。那边的！给我抓住他！带他去三号房，我想是免费的。
6192354999871351 没错。还好你没让我被处决了。被打上杀人犯的烙印，像狗一样被猎杀已经是无法挽回了。
6192354999871352 你找到杀害父亲的凶手了吗？
6192354999871353 算了吧。我的房子被你下令封了，小区也是。我需要钥匙和通行证。
6192354999871354 谢谢你，我昨晚睡得很舒服。但今天我想去我自己的地方。我需要钥匙。
6192354999871350 哦，是你。我们昨天让你成为头号嫌疑犯。工作失误，不好意思——过于鲁莽。你太像是个嫌疑犯了。\n 但是我不会听到你抱怨的。这个错误已经无法挽回了。
6192354999871356 很高兴某个聪明人告诉了你这些话。
6192354999871357 好极了。我父亲的遗体在哪？
6192354999871355 少挖苦我了，布拉克。\n，我们打开天窗说亮话。你还是个嫌疑犯，在凶手被发现并被证明有罪之前，你仍是个嫌疑犯。你现在还能自由活动的唯一原因是“无罪推定”，我说得够清楚了吗？
6192354999871359 我知道。一个农村。所以你就是警长。
6192354999871360 如果没有人在找凶手，你还好意思管这叫秩序？
6192354999871358 我不负责调查。没有有组织的搜索。我在这里没有正式职位，以防你对这方面有任何幻想。\n 我的权力就是我的名望。传统上，我们的家庭只有在非常罕见的情况下，当小镇崩离之际，才会掌权。相信我，这些都很罕见。这是一个宁静的小镇。
6192354999871362 你为什么不一开始就说？
6192354999871363 我得快点了。
6192354999871361 带到墓园了。他是一个大草原人，不是吗？通过金族人的仪式，死者将在死亡当天被埋葬，或者至少尽快被埋葬。所以准备工作已经开始了。
6192354999871365 我房子被锁了。你有钥匙吗？ 
6192354999871364 有什么我能帮你的吗？
6192354999871367 ...调查根本不存在，好极了。
6192354999871368 那委员会找到了什么？
6192354999871366 检查犯罪现场的委员会把房子锁上了。里面可能有证据。这符合你的最大利益。以及委员会的的利益。
6192354999871370 我会的。现在我需要钥匙。
6192354999871369 没什么有趣的。我们镇上没有专业的调查人员。这不难理解吧？\n 尽管凯恩家族从首都邀请了一位学员丹考夫斯基，对他们的总结表示了兴趣。我觉得和他分享发现是合适的。所以你可以问他。
6192354999871372 确实。
6192354999871373 所以我可以回家了？
6192354999871374 我需要通行证。你的人把街区封锁了。 
6192355001697055 尽管你非常想这么做。
6192354999871371 你可以有钥匙。那房子是你的财产，我没有法律依据阻止你进入。
6192354999871376 为什么？
6192354999871375 如果你现在去的话，也不会被允许进入的。 
6192354999871378 是个。给我签个通行证，我就不再打扰你。
6192354999871379 是的，我可以照顾好我自己的健康。 
6192354999871377 这个街区被封锁了根据我的命令——和学者 丹考夫斯基的建议。呆在那里可能不健康。只允许医务人员进入。\n但我记得你是个医生，对吗？
6192354999871381 该地区被你的人封锁了。我需要通行证。
6192354999871382 你是个暴脾气， 萨普洛夫。这可对你的健康不好。
6192354999871380 还有其他的吗？
6192354999871384 一个外科医生。
6192354999871385 一个医生，没错。
6192354999871386 这有什么关系吗？
6192354999871383 你是个医生，对吗？那样的话你可以拿通行证。
6192354999871388 对我来说够了。 把通行证给我。
6192354999871389 多管闲事，不是吗？我们大城市的贵客。
6192354999871387 我们的大城市的贵客，学者丹考夫斯基，已经发出警告，说该地区可能因医疗原因而不安全。我现在只能告诉你这些。
6192354999871391 值得称赞。公共安全显然做得很好。
6192354999871390 是的，你昨天见识了我们的监狱。\n但是，我亲眼看见了其他城镇的监狱，我要再说一遍：我不会听到你的抱怨。据我所知，食物又热又饱，帆布床又干，甚至老鼠也很有礼貌。我不会为我的工作道歉。
6192355000021052 这对我意味着什么？
6192355000021053 有道理。
6192355000021051 三大家族将招募志愿者来维护秩序。危险地区将被封锁。不能进入或退出。任何危害健康或财产的犯罪行为都将立即受到惩罚。
6192355000021055 是的。
6192355000021056 If only it could be figured out at once…
6192355000021054 你是个医生，所以你有特权。与其他人不同的是，你可以进入——更重要的是——可以从感染区离开。\n 我们依赖你的责任感。如果你发现自己被感染了，你就不会试图隐藏或传播它。对吧？
6192355000419694 I'm used to disappointment.
6192355000419695 Good to see you've kept your sense of humor.
6192355000419698 That's okay, I've brought my own.
6192355000419693 啊，布拉克。如果你已经厌倦了你的医疗职责，想加入镇守队，你会失望地离开。你的专长会被浪费在街上。\n 更不用说我们的皮革大盖帽快用完了。
6192355000419697 What urchin?
6192355000419699 Are they planning another burning?
6192355000419700 I'm here to check on you. You're clearly overworked.
6192355000419696 今天什么风把你吹了过来？猎杀携带瘟疫的顽童？\n如果是这样的话，别打扰我，我的门廊已经挤满了志愿者。口袋里装满了火柴和火种，没有常识的余地。6192355000419702 With those layabouts, I assume?
6192355000419703 Never thought I'd hear praise from you.
6192355000419701 别担心，我很好。这些天每个人都工作过度。你，鲁宾斯，丹考夫斯基…所有的</i>真正的</i>工人，不同于那些游手好闲的人，\n 我可以用你的帮助来处理另一件事。
6192355000419705 How can I help?
6192355000419708 Little? Clearly not your… ward, if that's who you're talking about.
6192355000419704 他们今天早上来了，声称找到了携带者。一个无家可归的小女孩，明显感染了病毒，但仍然活着，而且很好。\n 我对他们说的顽童非常了解！放心，她与此事无关。
6192355000419707 That's right. I'll tell them to stay their hands.
6192355000419715 I'll remind them of the shabnak hunt and how <i>that</i> went.
6192355000419716 Let them riot. There's no stopping them.
6192355000419706 你是个医生。他们会比我更信任你。告诉他们他们弄错了。更好的是，如果他们抓住她，他们不会伤害她。没有她，我们就死定了。不是吗？丹考夫斯基告诉我的，关于他的疫苗计划。
6192355000419710 How exactly?
6192355000419711 Little… little urchin… Wait! That's not 克拉拉, that's another girl!
6192355000419709 确切地。他们因为一些胡说八道的话情绪激动。必须有人让他们冷静下来。
6192355000419713 I mean… Maybe. Just a thought.
6192355000419714 Never mind.
6192355000419712 What? Which girl?
6192355000421961 Weren't you two getting along?
6192355000421962 "我们"?
6192355000421960 丹考夫斯基。
6192355000421964 Yeah, I know what you mean.
6192355000421965 In our town, that's an advantage.
6192355000421963 He is too… rational for the problem at hand.
6192355000421967 What's wrong with her?
6192355000421978 It's impossible for one person to help another.
6192355000421966 My wife is very ill, 布拉克. I'm not sure how to help her.
6192355000421969 Go on. I'll keep this confidential.
6192355000421979 I'm a surgeon, not a head doctor.
6192355000437851 Your wife considers herself a Mistress. She's supposed to see things no one else does.
6192355000421968 She seems to be losing her mind. She… she is obsessed with… things. Strange things.
6192355000421971 What kind of being?
6192355000421972 I see. I'll take a look at her.
6192355000421970 卡特琳娜 believes she cares for our town as if she were… some mystical ruler. She is delirious.\nI think she… communicates with <i>something,</i> some being.
6192355000421974 I understand. I'll examine her.
6192355000421977 It's hard to speak about these things.
6192355000421973 I'm not used to speaking about these matters. My mind tells me she is imagining it, but at times, I can hear it respond to her.\nYet, when I enter her room, I find her sitting alone on the bed, and I can't muster the courage to speak to her.
6192355000467745 What evidence?
6192355000467853 …That's not what I expected.
6192355000467744 Ah, 布拉克. As you can see, we're making progress with your case. There's plenty of evidence against him.
6192355000467852 What evidence?
6192355000467854 So what are you going to do with him?
6192355001638979 I already have.
6192355000468251 I would, thanks.
6192355000467851 Solid evidence. Would you like to speak with him yourself?
6192355001638980 Don't. It wasn't him. We've talked.
6192355000467856 Wait. I want to speak with him first.
6192355000467857 Will they? I wouldn't want to find myself in prison at a time like this.
6192355000467855 In times like these, we can't get bogged down with investigations and hearings. Throw him in prison. Let him stay there… until things calm down.
6192355000468253 So, who is the investigator?
6192355000468254 So, as the head, what will you do with him?
6192355000468252 He was with 伊西多 the night of the murder. He followed your 父亲 through the steppe at night. They were seen together. His story doesn't add up.\nIs that enough? I'm not an investigator, I'm the head of my house! And in these strange, strange times, the governor of this mad circus.
6192355001638972 Put him in prison. Let him stay there. It's safer that way.
6192355001638973 It's not him. I'm sure of it. You can release him now.
6192355001638971 Well?
6192355001638975 Very well.
6192355001638976 I'll find the murderer myself, Governor. I trust myself more.
6192355001638977 Then my opinion is this: Prison's no place for an innocent man.
6192355001638974 That, 布拉克, is ultimately not your decision. I only wanted your opinion. I will do with him as I see fit.
6192355000467747 Put him in prison. Let him stay there. It's safer that way.
6192355000467748 It's not him. I'm sure of it. You can release him now.
6192355000467746 Well?
6192355000467750 Very well.
6192355000467858 I'll find the murderer myself, Governor. I trust myself more.
6192355000467859 Then my opinion is this: Prison's no place for an innocent man.
6192355000467749 That, 布拉克, is ultimately not your decision. I only wanted your opinion. I will do with him as I see fit.
6192355000467861 What other matter?
6192355000467864 No, don't do anything to him without my input. I have a few questions to ask him first.
6192355000468264 You work fast. Another one, already? Just as guilty as the first?
6192355000467860 Ah, yes. 布拉克. Just when I needed you… Although, I actually need you for another matter. I'll figure out what to do with this wretch myself.\nI suspect foul play. Since you're here, you may speak with him, if you like.
6192355000467863 Wait. I'll speak with him.
6192355000467865 Go ahead and send them off. I'll pay him a visit in prison later.
6192355000467862 I wish to talk to you alone. Make this troglodyte's acquaintance if you like, or simply wait. We can start as soon as I send off the convoy.
6192355000468266 Probably not. But I would like to speak with him.
6192355000468267 What did you want to talk about?
6192355000468265 Who knows. Maybe you can find out?
6192355000772160 I'm sorry for your loss.
6192355001415551 Who is she, then?
6192355001415552 She never was one.
6192355000772159 卡特琳娜 is no longer a Mistress.
6192355001415554 Earth spoke to her. Most people would find that unbearable.
6192355001415555 What was she like before?
6192355001415556 Well… Earth won't speak to her anymore. Or to anyone else.
6192355001415553 You know nothing of her! This cursed town smothered her. Forced a stupid role on her. She got it in her head that she had to be anyone but herself. That's the kind of town we live in…\nShe used to be different. Completely different…
6192355001415558 How?
6192355001415562 Oh no…
6192355001415557 There'll be other Mistresses in the town. Leave them alone. And 卡特琳娜… she'll start by bringing the Cathedral back to life.
6192355001415560 A member of the community who expects to know how you're planning to govern us.
6192355001415561 I'm sorry.
6192355001415559 Who do you think you are, expecting me to talk about my wife with you?
6192355001415564 Something feels wrong about it.
6192355001415565 Just tell me she's not religious. Anything's better. Even a second plague.
6192355001415563 You'll see.
6192355001415567 You never know. You've got your whole life ahead of you.
6192355001415568 You still have the Town.
6192355001415566 …Sometimes I feel like I was born to be a widower.
6192355001449152 Sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
6192355001449153 Yes. There's a life ahead of us now.
6192355001449151 Honestly! Are you actually trying to console me?
6192354999936857 亚历山大·萨普洛夫
6192355001258467 亚历山大·萨普洛夫
6192354999871393 ...我从楼梯上摔了下来。
6192354999871394 你是谁？
6192354999871392 你为什么浑身是血？
6192354999871396 真的？
6192354999871397 我是老布拉克的儿子。
6192354999871395 那并不重要。 重要的是<i>你</i>是谁。
6192354999871399 我是这里的人，但是我离开了很久。
6192354999871400 喂，孩子，你为什么这么盯着我？
6192354999871398 你是个外乡人。我从没见过你，我认识所有人。
6192354999871402 我<i>就是</i>他的儿子。
6192354999871401 你确实看起来像那个老家伙。你可能是他的儿子。
6192354999871404 不关你的事。
6192354999871405 你难道没看到街上现在是什么样的吗？
6192354999871406 ...你有什么毛病吗，小子？
6192354999871403 我想知道的是，你为什么浑身是血？
6192354999871408 我也是。很高兴认识你。
6192354999871409 我的建议，小子？管好你的嘴。
6192354999871407 随意...不过我会记住你的。
6192354999871411 ...你在做什么，怪人？
6192354999871412 天呐...这里发生了什么？
6192354999871413 哦...我的一个老朋友。
6192354999871410 我没有碰任何东西！
6192354999871415 ..同时不要碰任何东西。我明白了。
6192354999871416 你是说你在训练？
6192354999871417 在研究开锁技巧？
6192354999871414 你才是怪人。你看不出来吗？我在工作。
6192354999871419 洗耳恭听。
6192354999871420 听起来很可疑。
6192354999871418 狗才需要训练，我需要把事情搞定。 I
6192354999871422 明白了。你是在...抓老鼠，还是干什么？ 
6192354999871423 你会的，如果我想的话。
6192354999871421 我不会走的。你明白了吗？
6192354999871425 看不出来你还挺聪明的。
6192354999871426 那桌子上的那东西是什么？你是自己做的，嗯？
6192354999871424 你吼那么大声干什么？老家伙和我，我们以前在这里做过很多事情！我甚至知道如何使蓝盐结晶。我自己做了提取物。你以为我只是在帮他？我知道很多东西！
6192354999871428 注意你的言行。那是什么？
6192354999871429 好吧，如果你是这里的好人，那就继续，<i>好心</i>告诉我你是怎么进来的。
6192354999871427 没必要这么不友好。（？）
6192354999871431 所以你知道怎么操作它？
6192355000258352 哈...你的确知道它怎么工作。 
6192354999871430 是个混合器。老家伙以前在这里做药。就像……酊剂，我想是这么称呼的。提炼。从各种恶心的东西。
6192354999871433 这个机器是什么？
6192354999871434 所以我父亲根本没给你钥匙！我以为你是他的徒弟……但你更像一只猫。
6192354999871432 简单。毕竟，当老家伙在大草原上行走时，需要有人操作机器。所以我自愿参加的。我们这种人不需要钥匙。
6192354999871436 我们瞅瞅。也许我可以修好它。 
6192354999871437 好吧，你这个小淘气鬼，留下来。这里有足够的空间给我们俩。
6192355000874884 我刚修好了它，你没注意吗？ 
6192354999871435 出于某种原因，它们都没法运转。你能修好吗？我会…我会做任何事。只是别逼我走。
6192354999871439 你是说这个机器？
6192354999871438 嘿！你知道，我可以自己做一个止疼药混合物！我可以清洗机器！我可以把它拆开，再把它拼起来，所有的碎片！
6192355001107366 我们今天给谁做手术，医生？
6192355001107367 坚持不懈，不是吗？像水蛭一样粘人…
6192355001107368 我不打孩子。所以也不要打我……否则我可能会崩溃。
6192355001107365 别打我，好吗？嗯……你要想打我得要一个好理由。成交？
6192354999982729 告诉我详情。
6192354999982730 当然，随意。
6192354999982731 想都别想，我需要你在这。
6192354999982728 你知道，我今天收到了一个小小的商业建议。整个工作都很糟糕，但我们乞丐不能挑肥拣瘦，是吗？
6192354999982733 你怎么藏一具尸体？
6192354999982734 为什么？
6192354999982737 把你鼻子擦一擦。
6192354999982732 工作就是隐藏死尸。镇上的居民不敢交出死人。
6192354999982736 所以呢？
6192354999982740 是的，我知道墓园的问题。
6192354999982741 是"丹考夫斯基."
6192354999982735 首先，人们死在的房子被隔离并用木板封起来……人们还在里面。这是达科夫斯基的命令。\n 第二，墓园里没有空间了，所以尸体会被烧掉。镇上的居民对此并不买账。格里丝一定很担心。
6192354999982739 你到是说啊，什么工作？ 
6192354999982749 那人们把他们藏在哪里...?
6192354999982738 不管怎样，人们需要把尸体藏起来。臭气很快就成了问题。正是这种散发的气味出卖了他们。毕竟不能把它们放进冰盒里。
6192354999982743 所以呢？
6192354999982742 王八蛋科夫斯基。他认为他是镇上唯一一个知道汤匙的哪一端伸进你嘴里的人。\n 当他说的时候，人们都争先恐后去服从他。甚至牛老爷也向他鞠躬。凯恩家族崇拜他。
6192354999982746 不要太粗鲁。告诉我更多关于尸体的事情。
6192354999983663 哦，我很想看看，相信我。
6192354999982745 也许我也应该戴领结，当我在的时候？
6192354999982748 那就是提供给你的工作？
6192354999982750 "防腐"
6192355000002489 什么药剂师？
6192354999982747 所以，心房区里有个药剂师。他做了一些防止腐烂的混合物。聚集了一些人，大约五十岁，也许更多……现在他们在晚上到处乱跑给尸体仿佛。
6192354999983652 悄无声息是你的特色属性。
6192354999983653 那是…嗯，如果你比现在大学些我会说更多的，但那只是缓慢的自杀！
6192354999983651 不错，现在有很多人愿意为赚快钱做任何事。包括我在内。他们暗示要我也招你入伙。悄无声息地。
6192354999983655 这破事发生在哪？
6192354999983654 为什么？他们已经做好防腐工作了啊！
6192354999983657 听起来这像是丹考夫斯基该解决的烂摊子。
6192354999983661 我要和你们的药剂师好好谈一谈。去接受这个提议吧，因为这之后我会需要一个证人。
6192354999983662 把尸体留在室内是无法接受的。我得结束这一切。
6192354999983656 所以你打算怎么做？
6192354999983659 搞得好像我要干的活还不够多。
6192354999983660 我猜你是对的...
6192354999983658 镇上到处都是。他们在晚上安静地工作。没有人会在他们行动中抓住他们。
6192355000002491 什么工作？和死人一起干活？ 
6192355000002490 我怎么可能知道。还没见过他。但无论如何，心房区的药店可没几家。
6192355000026972 你他妈在干什么？
6192355000026973 把那个放回去。离开桌子！
6192355000026974 听着，你这个小混……这是你最后一次未经允许碰我的东西。知道了？
6192355000026971 也许药草是错的……但是老家伙用了这些……但我想我记不清了……
6192355000026976 For freckles?
6192355000026977 Wow. You must be a trained doctor.
6192355000026975 Whaddya want from me? Can't you see I'm making a cure?
6192355000026979 Yes, that's the kind of man 父亲 was. You and I are in a different league.
6192355000026980 You're too young. I'll do it without you.
6192355000219955 Yeah… I could use a cure for the blues now.
6192355000026978 …老家伙可以做出任何药剂。一块这个，一块那个……一份草药酊剂……他修复了一切，从关节脱臼到忧伤。
6192355000026986 A poultice, huh? No. Poultices won't save us.
6192355000026987 You know, perhaps the burning is fine? If it helps someone survive.
6192355000026988 Shush! I'm thinking.
6192355000026985 I mean, you're in no hurry, right? So I'll make the cure myself. I remember some things… Maybe like a poultice, at least, so it wouldn't burn so bad.
6192355000033696 The plan… The plan is this. Do you know what a serum is, kid?
6192355000033693 …So? What's the plan? Did you lose your tongue?
6192355000033698 Not you. But I can try. Though it takes time…
6192355000033699 Sure. We need someone who wouldn't die of the infection. But we haven't met anyone like that yet…
6192355000033700 We can… Regardless of whatever some <i>cocksure</i> doctors say.
6192355000033697 Can we make that?
6192355001169051 With 父亲's apparatus over there. The big one, I mean. I can't brew anything while it's broken, but I don't have a toolkit either… Shudkher!
6192355000033702 With infected organs. We need to inspect them more closely, and mix what we find with something else, too.
6192355000033703 This is my job, kid. But don't worry, I won't leave you behind.
6192355000033705 We start with deliberation, and only move to action after that.
6192355000033701 So now what? Where do we start?
6192355000219959 No, I mean a blood serum. A cure. Serum treatment.
6192355000219960 So imagine a person gets infected, right? Their body begins fighting the sickness. Creates antibodies.
6192355000219958 I do. It's the thing that makes people tell the truth.
6192355000219964 I know all that.
6192355000219965 A panacea? Fairy tales will do you no good.
6192355000219966 I think you should aim right for the philosopher's stone, kid. Piece of cake.
6192355000219963 D'you live under a rock or something? An alarm rang across the whole Town. Only you and deaf folks haven't heard about the Sand Plague yet…\nA cure needs to be made. A… what's the word? A panacea?
6192355001169053 My help with what? Carrying the box, or following up on old debts? Then again, who cares…
6192355001180774 Turns out, you <i>are</i> of help. I think we'll get along just fine.
6192355001663551 You'll get me nothing! Stay put. I'll find one myself.
6192355001169052 Hey, I know where we can get a toolkit! I'll get it for you… I mean, for us. \nThere's this place in the Atrium… and this guy who owes me. But I'll need your help. All right? The box is heavy, I can't carry it on my own.
6192355000033735 Did you see that thing just now?
6192355000033736 Ironic.
6192355000033734 So when are we doing field work? I'm sick of sitting around here.
6192355000033738 So you didn't notice anything? At all?
6192355000033741 Why are you so eager?
6192355000033737 I've seen everything around here. I remember every corner. I could totally pawn my eyes now, 'cause I don't even need them anymore. \nSo will you take me to do fieldwork?
6192355000033740 That's what I thought.
6192355000033742 And the conversation? Did you hear it?
6192355000033739 I guess there was a gust of wind. Like a draft. You forgot the door, maybe?
6192355000033744 We need to find a sick person. An easier task than I'd like.
6192355000033745 <i>I</i> will. Not you.
6192355000033743 …So you've made a sample, right? Are we going to test it or now?
6192355000033747 Observation is not required. We'll know the results immediately.
6192355000035552 They'll be observed at the hospital.
6192355000035553 It's just the first sample. We're at the beginning of a long journey.
6192355000033746 So you'll give your sample to the sick person, but then they need observation, right? I can help. Deal? I'll wear a face mask and everything…
6192355000033749 Oh, I can provide <i>that</i> kind of teaching all right.
6192355000033750 Patience.
6192355000035551 Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
6192355000033748 Pffft. Big surprise. You know, I'll leave one day. At least the Old Man taught me about herbs. You don't care. You wouldn't even beat me if I broke rules.
6192355000035555 I think I just got a new friend. They'll tell me.
6192355000035556 I'll look inside them when they die. Something's bound to change.
6192355000035557 也许我该问问丹考夫斯基.
6192355000035554 What if it doesn't help? How will you know what to do next?
6192355000193309 Well… I think I figured something out. About the cure.
6192355000198151 I just don't see too many reasons to celebrate, to be honest.
6192355000193308 Why the long face? 发生了什么?
6192355000198153 I know what kind of organic sample we need. But I've got no idea where to find it.
6192355000198154 No.
6192355000198152 Will you tell me?
6192355000198156 So, bulls have antibodies, right? Cells that destroy the disease. And people can carry the microbe itself in their blood, but they can't weaken it. Do you understand? I can't get the two together. But I need to.
6192355000198157 <i>C'mon</i> me once again and I'll make you clean floors. Got it?
6192355000198155 C'mon, keep talking! Do I need to pry every single word out of you?
6192355000198165 I need some sort of… minotaur. But they don't exist.
6192355000198166 No, I can't just mix the two samples. They're too different. Long story.
6192355000198164 So what? Can't you mix them?
6192355000198168 I'll look for a creature that combines the traits of both man and bull.
6192355000198169 The world, you know… It's more alive than it looks. Some things seem inanimate, but when you peer closer…
6192355000198170 Not sure. Not yet.
6192355000198167 So what's your plan now?
6192355000198172 Badly.
6192355000198173 Well, I never expected to succeed right away.
6192355000198171 So, how's it going?
6192355000198175 The best our antibiotics can do is stall the disease.
6192355000231954 No. We need a serum that can cure the plague once and for all.
6192355000198174 But you can make… um, that stuff that cures the disease. Antibiotics. You said that yourself.
6192355000231952 It's lucky for those infected that I'm in charge instead of you.
6192355000231953 If you increase the dose, the patient will simply die.
6192355000231951 Meaning we just increase the dose, right? Then they'll be cured.
6192355000231956 We need a different organic tissue… of some kind.
6192355000231957 We need a creature that can withstand this disease. And I don't think it will be human.
6192355000231955 So how do we make a panacea, then?
6192355000254902 Tools. Forget it. But tell me: What business did you have with my 父亲? Old 布拉克?
6192355000254901 What's that you're carrying?
6192355000254906 So you used to go to his place together? All of you? Look at this list of names.
6192355000254904 Well… we actually went to his place a lot. He used to teach us things. 为什么？
6192355000254908 What did he want from you?
6192355000254909 Maybe one of you know how he died, then? What about you, huh?
6192355000254910 So you were his friends. Did he have enemies?
6192355000254907 Sometimes we'd all go together. Sometimes just two or three… or alone. A lot of stuff happened. Why do you care, though? It's not like we were bothering him. He invited us!
6192355000254912 Think, okay?
6192355000254913 Kid, you're obviously hiding something. But this is very important to me. Do you understand?
6192355000254911 Nope.
6192355000254915 卡佩拉? 那是谁？
6192355000254916 奥吉姆斯基的女儿...为什么是她？
6192355000254914 你知道吗？问卡佩拉。她是我们所有人中年龄最大的，而且最擅长解释事情。也是个好人。
6192355000254918 A… union? What union?
6192355000254919 …Very well, I'll go talk to her.
6192355000254917 She's like… a big sister to us all. She created the union.
6192355000254924 Is it a good thing or a bad thing that they're different?
6192355000254925 Good.
6192355000254923 Fat 维拉德's daughter. But she's not like him at all. She even lives in a separate wing of the house.
6192355001195660 Okay.
6192355001195661 Good. Tight lips are a good skill to have.
6192355001195662 Is she at her place, in the Lump?
6192355001195659 Don't worry about it. Just a union. Of people under fifteen. Anyway, ask her. She might be mad at me if I say too much.
6192355001195664 The Station is a discreet place? Trains have become rare indeed…
6192355001195665 I won't stomp around. I'll just take a peek.
6192355001195663 Damned if I know. Either there or at the Station. Just… don't stomp around if you ever go there. It's a discreet place, not for the grown-ups.
6192355000731158 The alembic? It does.
6192355000731163 Only one of them.
6192355000731157 So, does it work now?
6192355000731160 I'll fix it, too.
6192355000731164 I don't know yet.
6192355000731159 What about the big one?
6192355000731162 I'll need a special toolkit for it.
6192355000731165 I'll find the components myself.
6192355000731161 Would you like me to look for scrap metal? What do you need to fix it? Cogs and stuff?
6192355000874886 I was just remembering 父亲.
6192355000874887 I'm fine, you little familiar. And healthy. And I don't pass out.
6192355000874885 Hello? Anyone in there? Can you hear me?\nFor a moment, you just stood there… feeling bad, maybe? The air's thick here in September; breathe in too deep and you'll pass out.
6192355001486152 I know where to find toolkits. I wasn't born yesterday.
6192355001486153 Hm. Well, I haven't seen a single toolkit anywhere over these past few days. So if you find one, let me know.
6192355001486154 I'll find one myself… at some point.
6192355001486151 Oh… You can find toolkits in shops. But rarely. But it's doable. But I don't think anyone's selling one now. But if I see one, I'll let you know.
6192355000772497 What's left to do?
6192355001371678 Not sure. But we'll live.
6192355001371679 Any suggestions?
6192355000772496 So what's the plan now?
6192355001371681 I guess I'll have to teach someone, if I want to leave this place in ten years or so.
6192355001371682 No. I'd rather someone taught <i>me…</i>
6192355001371683 It depends on your progress.
6192355001371680 Will you teach me?
6192355001371685 What?
6192355001371686 I thought you were already a learned specialist.
6192355001371684 Well… first we'll need to settle down, of course. Fix up the household. And then… okay, I made up my mind. I'll be your student.
6192355001371688 I'm kidding. Where would I go? I'm bound to this town now.
6192355001371689 Elsewhere.
6192355001371690 To the sea, of course. Merchant navy. Any ship would welcome a good doctor.
6192355001371687 Leave? Where the hell are you planning to go?
6192355001371692 That's where you're wrong, kid. It <i>will</i> survive. That was the whole point. Perhaps it won't ever die.
6192355001371693 Don't shift responsibility. The Town needs <i>you</i> kids, not me. You're the ones who will restore it. That's why 父亲 protected you.
6192355001371694 If it doesn't survive, it wasn't that great in the first place. Good riddance.
6192355001371691 You… you can't abandon us now. We need to fix the Town, right? It's on its last legs… It won't survive without you.
6192355000995054 Who?
6192355000995055 Don't <i>c'mon</i> me, kid. I'm coming.
6192355000995053 Wake up! Someone's looking for you! C'mon!
6192355000995057 If it's not 西蒙 凯恩 himself, you are <i>so</i> grounded.
6192355000995058 What time is it?
6192355000995056 Someone important. I wouldn't be waking you otherwise.
6192355000995060 Yeah, he did. Thanks for the heads-up.
6192355000995061 Well excuse me, doctor, for being cranky. Us paramedics should really be humbler around you.
6192355000995059 I can tell you what time it isn't—it <i>isn't</i> time to sit on your hands. People always wake doctors up. That's what the Old Man used to say…
6192355001135268 I know a lot of anecdotes, all right.
6192355001185163 It wasn't true, though. Just a medical joke.
6192355001185164 I never said anything like that. You misheard.
6192355001135267 You're one smooth talker! Almost got entranced myself. When you told him about that bush in the man's guts… Will you tell me more? I didn't catch everything through the wall.
6192355001166054 I don't talk. I do.
6192355001166053 Yeah… A silvertongue, you aren't. I couldn't get to the toolbox. Only grabbed a few small items.
6192355001166056 You little risk-taker…
6192355001185159 Let's skip out of here. Fast.
6192355001166055 Done and done! Got it. There, in the bag.
6192355001166058 Let's see…
6192355001185162 You'll carry everything. Let that burden be your lesson about conscience.
6192355001185166 That's one huge bag…
6192355001166057 In any case, the loot is plenty. There, in the bag. I could barely drag it out. Take the heavy things, and I'll carry the rest.
6192355001166060 Like we have a choice…
6192355001185155 No, we'll return to the shop and sell it back! Ugh, why did I even agree to this…
6192355001166059 So, is the toolkit any good? Can we repair the alambic now?
6192355001185152 Scouts? What do they scout, I wonder?
6192355001185167 I already know… They were looking for trouble and found it. Come on, we have to get back to work.
6192355001647062 I've heard what the little morons are up to… If only they washed their hands half as eagerly as they draw maps!
6192355001647063 I already know… They were looking for trouble and found it. Paid for it with their leader's life. Come on. We need to get back to work.
6192355001185151 By the way… a bunch of Soul-and-a-Halves just walked by. New scouts. They have something for you. Said they want to help out "the son"—that's you, the Old Man's son.
6192355001185154 Little morons… Are they out of their minds?
6192355001185165 So we now have three dozen little plague carriers on our hands. Lovely.
6192355001185168 As if we didn't have enough trouble already. All right, I'm going.
6192355001185153 The infection. It moves around the Town, changes districts. They map it.
6192355001185157 So I take it someone here hasn't been spanked in a while?
6192355001185158 It depends…
6192355001185156 Not a thinker, either.
6192355001166052 What are you up to, kid? Robbing his storeroom?
6192355001169059 Sure, nothing to it.
6192355001166051 So here's the plan.\nGo into the shop and ask the merchant something… complicated. Just make sure he gets carried away in the conversation. The longer and louder you talk, the better. Keep him occupied. Distracted. Got it?
6192355001184552 Whoa… Hold your horses. So I'm providing shelter for a little crook?
6192355001184553 What do you mean, "used to"?
6192355001184551 Don't worry, I'm used to these kinds of jobs. I won't get caught.
6192355001184555 Work?
6192355001184561 You've crawled through vents since you were very little, too?
6192355001184554 I can crawl through any vent. I've been an orphan since I was very little. What else am I supposed to do?
6192355001184557 Why did you lie to me? You said a guy here owed you!
6192355001184571 "For fun." For fun!
6192355001184556 Hey, come on! I'm no thief! I only do it for fun. Well, unless I get real hungry… Hunger does that to people.\nI also leave small trinkets behind, sometimes. Like mementos.
6192355001184559 "Jobs." You mean crimes.
6192355001184560 I do. I cut up bodies.
6192355001184558 Cleaning Fat Belly's cauldrons at the cannery? Sure, I'll get right on it.\nWork… Freedom is better. Who wants to cut up a bunch of bodies all day and night, anyway? Nah. I prefer <i>jobs</i> over work.
6192355001184563 So he's a fence, then…
6192355001184564 Patches, huh…
6192355001184567 And where did <i>they</i> get it from? Just found it in the steppe?
6192355001184562 Well, he does! Do you have <i>any</i> idea how stingy that man is? He never pays more than half price for whatever you get him.\nWho do you think he got the toolkit from in the first place? Strain and Patches brought it to him. They carried the thing all the way from the Tanners, and he only paid half a hundred!
6192355001184566 Make up your mind about how you're trying to convince me.
6192355001184572 The law matters, kid. Come on, let's go home.
6192355001184565 Stop being so stubborn, will you? I'd never offer you anything unfair. Illegal, maybe, but it won't stain your conscience.\nAnd, in any case… the cure is more important, isn't it?
6192355001184569 Your lack of shame is honestly impressive.
6192355001184570 What an incredible feat.
6192355001184568 Nah. In the street.
6192355001184574 No chance, kid. We should buy that toolkit fair and square. That'll be a lesson for you.
6192355001184575 All right. Let's do it. Just don't get caught.
6192355001184573 Come on! It's easy! Just talk to him for as long as you can and make sure he doesn't break conversation. The longer you keep him, the more I'll be able to… repossess.
6192355001362412 Who?
6192355001373353 So you can see them, too?
6192355001362411 Listen… Where did they come from?
6192355001373352 I don't know.
6192355001385951 From the steppe, apparently. Where else?
6192355001385952 The Earth brought them to life, kid. That's the kind of earth we walk on.
6192355001373351 The bulls!
6192355001380652 Doesn't seem so.
6192355001380655 I hope.
6192355001380651 They're kinda hard to miss! What, are they not real? Like a… hallucination?
6192355001380654 Aurochs. The bulls of steppe legends.
6192355001380656 Bos Turokh… That's what they call the bull that created the world. I thought he was unique. One of a kind.
6192355001385953 No idea, kid. I'm as bemused as you are.
6192355001380653 What <i>are</i> they, anyway?
6192355001385955 That's the name. "Baur Meges." A tale of the world's creation. I had no idea you read those kinds of books.
6192355001385956 Perhaps… So 萨巴's wish did come true. Or was it her plan?
6192355001385957 Are you scared?
6192355001385954 All the streets are like… those old tales of yours. Like that book, "Baur Meges." Is this it? Did the steppe flood us all?
6192355001385959 Yeah? Well, I am.
6192355001385964 Never again. That much is true.
6192355001385958 Scared? Are you nuts? When will I ever see anything like this again?
6192355001385961 I don't know. Let's walk around… and witness what we've done.
6192355001385965 This is what I wanted, you know. To preserve things almost extinct. Things that would otherwise be ground to dust by time, because tomorrow had no place for them.
6192355001385960 What will become of… everything, now? Huh? Come on, tell me! Hey!
6192355001362439 I'd never been here, either… Until recently.
6192355001385976 So how do you like it?
6192355001385977 This is no place for children. It's antithetical to your world. Kids and beasts… inhabit the opposing ends of the vale of life.
6192355001362438 I never thought I'd end up here… No matter how hard I tried to get inside, I couldn't. Admittedly, I was pretty scared of this place…
6192355001385979 "Vale." As in "valley."
6192355001385980 Vale of life, veil of death, wails of fate…
6192355001385981 Yeah, it's an odd idiom. I don't know what it means, either. Read it somewhere.
6192355001385978 "The veil of life"? I've only heard the veil of death…
6192355001385983 Those things you describe are in hell. We'll see them, in due time.
6192355001385984 Well, it does smell of meat… Blood, at least.
6192355001385986 It <i>is</i> a factory building.
6192355001385982 Thought it was just a factory building. Or storage, maybe. Cold. Hooks, chains, meat smells…
6192355001385988 It's the Earth turning about in her slumber. This place is closest to her.
6192355001385989 There's this pit here… Hell's gate. The howling comes from there.
6192355001385990 Those are the spirits of ancient bulls saying hello. Allow me to translate: "What are these <i>humans</i> doing here? Especially that small one?"
6192355001385987 And what are those sounds? Is there a beast howling? Or just the wind?
6192355001385992 That was a serious answer.
6192355001385993 Are you still surprised by anything?
6192355001385996 Everything is alive now, kid. So it expresses itself the best it can.
6192355001385991 Ugh. I was asking seriously!
6192355001363066 It was the 凯恩s' territory. A different town. Ours, but different.
6192355001385999 Just don't call the odonghs "worms" to their face. It offends them.
6192355001386009 You're right. It's strange.
6192355001363065 At first, I thought the steppe couldn't reach this quarter. The Upper Town, the Stone Yard… never welcomed the steppe. It was tough for them here. Too high. Lads used to say 虫人are best suited to the soil, but this place is all stone and sky.
6192355001386001 So what? Would you like it if I called you Freckleface all the time?
6192355001386002 Not exactly. But they are connected to the Earth.
6192355001386013 They do have faces. Do I need to teach you some respect, kid? Are they not people to you?
6192355001386000 What face? They <i>are</i> worms. Aren't they? Born of the Earth… Eating Earth, hearing Earth. Earthworms.
6192355001386006 I don't know. I've never seen it.
6192355001386007 Bullshit. Don't parrot nonsense.
6192355001386008 It's true, but be quiet. It's not nice to talk about it out loud.
6192355001386005 Is it true that those guys and the 草药新娘s have their own language? And their own rites, too? And they marry?
6192355001386011 Well… times change.
6192355001386012 Pray to what? Time flows differently now. Can you feel it?
6192355001386014 Go over and ask them.
6192355001386010 Why are they here? Why are they all sitting by the Crucible, looking at the Cathedral? What do they care? Did they come to pray?
6192355001386016 I think we'd better stay quiet.
6192355001386017 What is there to ask? It's all obvious.
6192355001386015 Like hell… You ask them.
6192355001386019 Look around. Don't you find it believable?
6192355001386024 They're big talkers.
6192355001386018 The 凯恩s said the Cathedral changes time itself. That's why they made it. But who would believe that…?
6192355001386022 Anyway, kid. I clearly see what I've done now. I guess it's for the best.
6192355001386023 That was a nice stroll. Go home and wait for me, all right?
6192355001386020 Fair enough.
6192355001386026 Saved all the things that surround us now. They were supposed to be ground down by time, to vanish. But now, they persevere.
6192355001386027 So that's what the doctor's oath was all about. Preserving life. I preserved all living things.
6192355001386031 Well… I made life interesting. It goes on, still as terrible and strange as before. People will have to find new roles in this ecosystem.
6192355001386025 What <i>have</i> you done?
6192355001386029 Yes, kid. Even the sand pest.
6192355001386030 <i>All</i> things.
6192355001386028 Even the sand pest?
6192355001512052 Remember how we first met? By 父亲's house…
6192355001512060 There'll be another time for goodbyes… Remember how you wanted to rob that shop? For a good cause?
6192355001512076 You didn't like 穆克 at first, remember? Were all so cranky…
6192355001512355 No. No goodbyes. We've just met, and now you want to say goodbye?
6192355001512356 I'm sorry, kid. Just be patient a little while longer.
6192355001512051 I don't feel too good. My eyes are burning, like I'm looking at hellfire. So, time to say goodbye, then? You know… just in case.
6192355001512054 "Funeral." It's "funeral wreaths" and "memorial candles."
6192355001512055 Memorial wreaths, my ass! No one's dying on my watch.
6192355001512053 穆克 dropped by. Brought a sack of herbs. I guess she wanted to make a wreath, but… well, the only wreaths we need now would be memorial.
6192355001512057 You wolfling…
6192355001512063 But I wasn't such a villain after all.
6192355001512056 Well, can't deny it anymore—I did think you were it, back then. The murderer, I mean…
6192355001512059 I will. Promise.
6192355001512074 If only I had enough raw material to make medicine for everyone!
6192355001512058 And we've done a great job! Now all you need is to brew the potions… right? Make some more?
6192355001512062 Patrolmen would have had a field trip with <i>that</i> combination.
6192355001512353 It's all for the best, pal. As it will be. Everything'll be all right, you'll see.
6192355001512061 It was a bad idea… We should have switched. I should have done the talking, and you, the robbing… I was too slow…
6192355001512066 I know better how to handle this.
6192355001512067 Quiet, you martyr. Let me think.
6192355001512068 I respect your attitude. Now hush and let me examine you.
6192355001512065 You just… you… help the others first, all right? I can bear it. The cauldron is close by. Working on me won't take long.
6192355001512070 Is that really your biggest concern now…?
6192355001512071 …
6192355001512075 That's all right. We'll do plenty of jobs in the future.
6192355001512069 Uh huh. You were on the verge of spanking me. "That's a lesson for you! Respect the law!" Like the law's ever done anything respectable.
6192355001519913 Yeah… living in a cellar isn't particularly fun. But neither is living in a train car.
6192355001512352 I'll cure you all, and we'll move into a normal house. We'll have a normal life…
6192355001512354 Fair enough. Thank you for that.
6192355001512351 Me? Cranky? No way!\nIt's different. You're never home, so I had to run the household. I was just… concerned. Trying to find food for us both…
6192355001525152 They do exist. Earth makes them from clay and bones… but they're not evil.
6192355001525161 I've seen them, too. So it wasn't the last… I hope. We'll find more. You'll see them with your own eyes!
6192355001525162 I believe you.
6192355001525151 You know… I had a dream.\nI saw that longneck once, the one your doll is shaped like… It does exist. I tried to track it, slept in the steppe… Everyone I told about it laughed at me…\nBut I have seen it! Honestly! It's the last vampire, a shabnak-adyg…
6192355001525160 真的。
6192355001525159 真的？
6192354999936858 史迪奇
6192355001258468 史迪奇
6192354999871458 我在哪？
6192354999871459 Was I unconscious?
6192355000179260 "Here"? Where is… here?
6192354999871457 振作起来！不要想这么轻而易举嗝屁，渣滓。在这里，我们按照自己的方式去死，而不是由别人来决定生死。
6192354999871461 What happened to me?
6192354999871462 I don't have a blanket. I'll drag you here, too, if you're ever in trouble…?
6192354999871460 听着，伙计，这不行。放弃了我自己的毯子来带你来这。猜猜你做了什么？…你把血都吐出来了，混蛋。你现在欠我一条毯子。一条漂亮的羊毛毯子。我也不介意看到你有点精神。你知道我的意思吗？
6192354999871464 坏格里夫, huh… we used to be friends, true. Surprised he's still alive.
6192354999871465 Well, thank you.
6192354999871466 So he's your leader now? Took the low road, I see…
6192355000718251 Done that already.
6192354999871463 你死得像个门钉。我们本来把你的牙齿拔出来，然后哇，原来你还活着！那边的庄稼说：“别碰我，你们这些秃鹫，他是坏格里夫小时候以来最好的朋友！”好吧，庄稼，这一次，可不是什么狗屎。现在坏格里夫很高兴，甚至还奖赏了我们。去吧，打个招呼，他在那边。
6192354999871468 I got it, I got it.
6192354999871469 Like hell.
6192354999871470 Since 坏格里夫's so happy I'm here, ask him.
6192354999871467 你欠我一条毯子。懂吗？给你一个小礼物，一个很薄的架子…
6192354999871472 I'm as respectful as it gets. How did I get here?
6192354999871471 In the Community. Be respectful, all right?
6192355000179257 I could use some bread.
6192355000179258 I need water. My skin's starting to crack.
6192355000179259 You're right… I need sleep.
6192355000179256 That you were, pal, that you were. Tired? Or do you need a bite? A drink? I can share. But you'll have to pay for the water. Not too much around.
6192354999936864 Fingersmith
6192354999871476 Getting armed and ready?
6192354999871477 How about sharp wit? It can cut deeper than a knife.
6192354999871478 Got a scalpel?
6192354999871475 Knives. Scissors. Blades. Razors. Anything sharp. If you've got a sharp axe, I'm interested.
6192354999871481 And what would you give me for sharp objects?
6192355000302378 Trust me, kid, you don't.
6192354999871479 Those items are what I barter for. We need them.
6192354999871483 So you trade needles for knives? Strange.
6192355000302374 Well, I see you're all experienced burglars here.
6192354999871482 Lockpicking shivs. If you're handy with locks, you can open three or four doors with one. Brand new! And needles. Good for smaller locks. Like locker locks.
6192354999871490 Nice try with the bullshit, but I'm not buying it. Razors aren't the only forbidden sharp objects. So where'd you get all those pins? Did you break into a tailor shop?
6192354999871491 I'm a local. I'm familiar with the law. Children aren't to touch sharp objects.
6192355000302383 And for a very good reason.
6192354999871489 Oh, so you aren't a local… We aren't allowed razors. If they catch us, we'll be grounded for a year. Might even get spanked!
6192355000302376 You're all grown up, aren't you? Now listen up, kid. Only butchers are allowed cutting tools in this town. Got it?
6192355000302377 Scissors for a needle is a good trade. Deal.
6192355000302375 Sure. A train full of needles derailed outside my window. Happy now? \nWhy do you care? We barter 'cause we don't need pins anymore. We've outgrown 'em.
6192355000302380 Sort of.
6192355000302381 By birth.
6192355000302382 I'm 一个外科医生。 It's like a butcher, but with a sharper knife.
6192355000302379 Are you a butcher?
6192355001186052 I'm just here to check in on Patches.
6192355001186054 Thanks for having me.
6192355001186051 Thanks for coming by.
6192355001186056 Dead? When did it happen?
6192355001638994 Dead? But how? I've cured him, I saw him get better with my own eyes!
6192355001186057 I'm sorry, kids.
6192355001186055 Ah. He's dead.
6192355001186059 We're all in a great deal of trouble.
6192355001186060 I'll find a cure, boy. I promise.
6192355001186058 Same day you examined him. In the evening. Never mind… \n诺克金 even asked 克拉拉 for help, in the end. But, like, she couldn't do anything either. Even she is helpless against the sand pest.
6192355001186062 Shudkher! No, no...
6192355001186063 No, kid. Humans don't get dog diseases. Not even the Soul-and-a-Halves.
6192355001653009 No, kid. It wasn't that. But 诺克金's better now.
6192355001186061 I fear 诺克金 could have caught the infection… But we hope it's just canine distemper.
6192355001186065 Is this an interrogation? Just wanted to see how you're doing.
6192355001186066 To check up on Patches. How's he doing? Getting better?
6192355001186064 Why did you come, anyway?
6192355001186068 What is it?
6192355001186067 Here. This is for you. Made by our scouts.
6192355001186070 It will.
6192355001186071 You shouldn't have risked it. I won't take it. And never do it again.
6192355001186072 You sneak into infected districts?
6192355001186069 A map of the infection. Our scouts sneak everywhere… Will it be useful?
6192355001186074 You little blockheads! This district would have been clear, if not for you! I won't take it!
6192355001186075 What do you mean, "carefully"?
6192355001186073 Very carefully. It's a public service! We want to help you doctors!
6192355001186077 You morons… <i>Morons!</i>
6192355001186078 Hand it over. And never do that again!
6192355001186076 It means what it means. Why do you think I'm sitting outside and not going in there?
6192355001594799 Sounds good.
6192355001651765 They why are you so gloomy?
6192355001594798 Biscuit brought pups. One was stillborn, but the rest are doing great.
6192355001638996 Damn these shmowders...
6192355001638997 克拉拉说了甚多事情。
6192355001638995 What cure did you use?\n克拉拉 says, the thing you gave him gnawed at him from the inside, so his organism just gave. He was very weak... "Some medicine is worse than poison," she said.
6192355001651753 So you didn't replace 诺克金 with another leader?
6192355001651754 为什么？
6192355001651755 I'm sorry...
6192355001651752 It sucks without the chief. Some folks have already scattered... you know how it goes. Jester yowls at night...\nBut the scouts are still going strong. And I won't leave for the Tower either. Screw it.
6192355001651759 I respect that.
6192355001651760 You should have.
6192355001651761 Why won't you go to the Tower?
6192355001651758 No.
6192355001651763 Impressively reasonable.
6192355001651764 Down here is where death is.
6192355001651762 Eh... I've been there. The Tower makes everything too easy. Any dream, any fantasy—you name it. It's like living on candy. One needs soup, too...\nDown here is where life is.
6192355001268554 Why do you have to be so stubborn...
6192355001381567 You imps!
6192355001381568 If you have a deathwish, fine. But you're spreading the infection too! How many times do I have to tell you!
6192355001268553 It's not like you can stop us anyway. We have no plans to fit on our hands. If you don't take it, another doctor will. A less squeamish one.
6192355001268556 Fine. Have it your way. Here's the deal then: I'll bring you protective medicine, enough for a couple of kids. And they'll be the only ones doing the scouting. Is that clear?
6192355001268555 You won't hold us all back.
6192355001381563 I'd rather trade it for a spanking.
6192355001381569 You forced me into this.
6192355001384951 I want to protect you, little rebels...
6192355001381562 We have the map of the infected districts. And we'll trade it to you for fat loot.
6192355001385967 I'll manage without it.
6192355001385968 I want you alive.
6192355001385966 So you don't want our map, huh?
6192355001385970 And then nothing. I'll figure something out.
6192355001385971 Such is fate, then.
6192355001385972 I'm not so easily infected. Unlike you, mutts.
6192355001385969 You're so brave now. But one day you'll walk into a district unprotected and bam! Infection in your face!\nOr someone will get infected because they've got plague at their doorstep, and you won't even know. And then what?
6192355001385974 A bargain, huh?
6192355001385975 You're welcome to all I have, troglodytes.
6192355001385973 Crystal clear. Thanks, mom.\nWe could find pills ourselves, we're not helpless, but sure. And if you're so kind, how about bringing other useful stuff too? In exchange, we'll make sure the map is top notch.
6192355001594805 You're on it again!
6192355001594806 No.
6192355001594807 I don't like this...
6192355001594804 Are you gonna take today's map of infected districts?
6192354999936859 Dandy
6192354999871496 Why are you doing this?
6192354999871497 Thank you. When I get my house back, come visit. I'll return the favor.
6192354999871495 Thank you, thank you for actually coming! You're so brave! Look, we all made a gift for you, to welcome you here. See? It's bread! Please don't frown… It's all we can spare. We need to eat, too. There's a lot of mouths to feed here.
6192354999871499 No, wait—keep this! Especially if you don't have much to give!
6192354999871500 So you kids are all hungry too?
6192354999871498 Sorry it's so stale! And drink the milk fast, because it'll go bad soon. But the water is fresh from a ravine!
6192354999871502 Ugh… Okay, I understand. You poor souls. I'll take it. Thanks.
6192354999871503 If I start taking food from half-starved urchins, I'll be the one with bad luck. Forget it.
6192354999871501 But you're a guest! Take it! Or else we'll get bad luck. We need luck more than food right now.
6192354999871505 I can't accept this gift.
6192354999871506 All right. Thanks for the gift, kids. It sure is timely.
6192354999871504 Well, yeah. We are on our own, after all.
6192355000851864 I brought you something to eat, to return the favor. Take it.
6192355001535873 I got nothing.
6192355000851863 What do you have there? Did you catch a tiny little mouse for me?
6192355000851867 Not now, kid. I'm covered in blood.
6192355000851868 Go ahead.
6192355000851869 I think I should come here more often. Maybe I'll start believing I'm a good person, too.
6192355000851866 We knew it! We knew you'd do it! Lina didn't believe it, Barrel didn't believe it, but Tom-Tom and I knew it: He'll figure it out on his own, he doesn't need nudges or hints to bring us something back. And you did! \nYou're such a good person. Can I hug you?
6192354999936860 Catnip
6192354999871516 管好你自己。那个家伙...我猜就是匹斯沃克？ 
6192354999871517 一个医生，坏格里夫那来的。告诉我发生了什么。
6192354999871515 你是...?
6192354999871519 中立人士。你有水吗？
6192354999871518 就是他，好的。你是我们一伙的吧？
6192354999871521 有水吗？
6192354999871520 我们中一个被割伤了，就是这样！一个利刃卡在了他肚子里。看见了吗？流了很多血。至少他现在还活着...
6192354999871523 “粉”？...你对做手术知道个锤子。
6192354999871524 酒精不能缓解疼痛，傻逼。
6192354999871522 没。不要忘记给他用酒精！或者粉，随便什么。必须先缓解疼痛。n否则这家伙会疼得满地打滚。
6192354999871527 是的，我看得出来你是拿到捅东西的大行家。这烂摊子是你捅出来的吧？
6192354999871528 是的，傻逼。我有手术刀，现在给我闭嘴我要干活。
6192355001173175 我本来有个手术刀...不过现在没了。
6192354999871526 但是你有什么能切东西的吧？这破玩意卡得太深了。我试图用刀取出来，但不管用。需要某种特殊的刀...手术刀？
6192354999871530 你杀了一个活生生的女人？
6192354999871531 什么刹那？你说的是什么玩意？
6192354999871532 我已经见识了木桩获刑。那就是你们的杰作？
6192354999871529 不！我们做的是老天的工作！谁害死了老布拉克?肯定是刹那。所以我们找到了杀人魔！\n然后一堆大草原的垃圾涌了进来，嚷嚷她不是刹那。他们掏出了利刃...十个对我们两个！ 
6192354999871534 你疯了吗？谁被你杀了？
6192354999871533 刹那，一个大草原生物，从大地中涌出。你不是本地人吧？ \n刹那不是人，是泥土和骨头。它的骨头是泥土做的，从下面看是的。外表像个大草原女孩，但是它两条腿都是瘸的。
6192354999871536 闭嘴，我在干活。
6192354999871537 坏格里夫告诉我检查下他的肚子，看看有没有他不需要的。这就是我做的事。
6192354999871535 我们为布拉克报仇雪恨。匹斯沃克逮住了她， \n不要那么盯着我。拜托，帮帮他！看不出他快死了吗？按坏格里夫说的去做。医生...
6192355001173177 以防你需要拿它切开一个无辜的女人？
6192355001173176 那就拿这个。我们留下它以防万一...
6192354999871539 这是什么...尖木条？
6192354999871540 他会活下去的。除非他死了。
6192354999871538 嘿，我可以听到他的呼吸了...一切正常了？ 
6192354999871542 我就是这里的人，我知道这个传统。
6192354999871543 传统和捅人有个屁关系，傻逼。更和把切开人一点关系都没有!
6192354999871541 你一定不是这里的人，这是当地传统。我们不用刀—他们称之为 <i>餐刀，</i>不过它不是用来切割的。\n对神灵毫无敬畏之心的野兽，它们置生死与度外，做出了这种...一次性东西。你捅一次，它们就断了。一切都遵循传统。
6192354999871545 我完全按我被告知的内容做的。我切除了所有他不需要的东西。
6192354999871546 我才刚刚开始呢。你就是下一个。所以你可以自己倒下，或者我来帮助你倒下。
6192354999871544 什么？你做了什么？你这个魔鬼！
6192354999936865 Shiner
6192354999871914 小心你的舌头，孩子。尽管我同意你的观点。
6192354999871915 是的，他在里面。如果你愿意，我在此授予你向他扔东西的一切权利。
6192354999871913 那又怎样，那混蛋还在里面吗？那个带地毯袋的？
6192354999871917 鲁宾不在这，小子！ We got zero 鲁宾s left in stock.
6192354999871918 That obnoxious dandy is a doctor. A well-trained one, I suspect.
6192354999871919 I'm a doctor. What's the issue?
6192354999871916 But where's Doctor 鲁宾? We need a doctor!
6192354999871921 Where are they?
6192354999871922 Sorry, poisons are not my area of expertise. I deal in broken jaws, cracked ribs… That kind of thing.
6192354999871920 There's been a disaster! Alma, Duke, and Wolfling were poisoned!
6192354999871924 He was probably right. You're obviously up to no good…
6192354999871925 What! Has he forgotten the Hippocratic Oath? I should give him a firm reminder…
6192354999871923 A doctor, my ass! We tried talking to him already, and he just shooed us away…
6192354999871927 Lead the way.
6192354999871928 All right, I'll check it out.
6192354999871929 I have enough on my plate right now, kids. Try to find 鲁宾.
6192354999871926 In a warehouse with little flags! Go down the railroad and to the left. You'll see it.
6192354999871931 Bones and a whistle are your cure for poison? Well, good luck with that.
6192354999871932 I will, I know that warehouse.
6192354999871930 I can't. We need to go to a drugstore, and find bones, and a whistle, and a shovel! Or 诺克金'll bite our heads off. You'll find the place on your own, it's easy.
6192354999936867 Ace
6192354999871934 I'm not. And I don't.
6192354999871935 The one and only.
6192354999871936 Oh? What's the description?
6192354999871933 You're the man everybody's after, right? You look like the description…
6192354999871938 What for?
6192354999871939 Not from me. Go home, girl.
6192354999871937 Really? Well, whatever… It's good we found you. We need help!
6192354999871942 The fastest judge in town is camping out at 鲁宾's place. Go see him. Cheers.
6192354999871941 Hold a trial? You kids play funny games.
6192354999871943 What? You've caught a murderer? Or was it <i>the</i> murderer?
6192354999871940 We need to hold a trial for a murderer. And we can't do it without you. Will you help?
6192354999871945 This is blackmail.
6192354999871946 Fine. Where's the courthouse?
6192354999871944 It's not a game, it's for real! 诺克金 said, "If you see him, drag him over." He also said, "Or else we'll choose the punishment on our own, and it won't end well."
6192354999871948 The warehouse with little flags? Oh, I remember… Seems like you kids took over our old place.
6192354999871949 You'll figure it out without me. I'm a bad judge.
6192354999871947 The courthouse is a warehouse. The one with little flags. Hurry up, they're starting soon!
6192354999871951 Let's go.
6192354999871952 Well, if you're telling the truth, then I'm in luck.
6192354999871950 It's kinda hard to say… So, will you come?
6192354999871954 Thanks, kid. At least I know what I look like now.
6192354999871955 My expression isn't stupid, kid. It's bewildered and confused.
6192354999871953 You know… Big, fat, dangerous, with bulgy eyes, a weird leg, a scary mug, and a stupid look on his face. Must be you.
6192354999871957 Here. You're all just trying to pressure me into something. Home sweet home, I guess.
6192354999871958 Forget it. If I'm around, I'll drop by. Maybe I'll get there in time to hear the verdict.
6192354999871956 Black… mail? Where?
6192354999884851 
6192354999936868 Ginger
6192354999871960 你们都在等谁？等我？
6192354999871961 我们的房子被锁了？谁下的令？
6192354999871962 发生了什么？说话啊！
6192354999940153 回家去，你们所有人。不要围观。
6192354999871959 那里...被关闭了。不允许任何人进入。不是我反对...但肯定是有命令。它是被下令封锁的。
6192354999871964 快继续啊！发生什么了？
6192354999871965 我知道。我马不停蹄地赶了过来。我父亲在哪?
6192354999940154 对，我回来了。
6192354999871963 所以你是布拉克的儿子，对吗？很久以前离开的那个？ 你错过了他几小时...不过这并不现实。\n你为什么不能早点回来呢，比如说昨天？一切将会大不一样。他等待你如此急切...
6192354999871967 我父亲去哪了？
6192354999940155 明白了。所以房子现在禁止入内... 
6192354999871966 萨普洛夫，当然。总督。
6192354999871969 ...死了？！
6192354999871970 不，这不可能。
6192354999871968 老布拉克死了。
6192354999871972 我也不。
6192354999871973 所以他是今天夜里被杀死的。
6192354999871971 死了。没人知道怎么死的。有传言说他是被谋杀的。一派胡言。 他对我们所有人都像父亲一样。谁会杀了他？ 这种说法我可不买账。
6192354999871974 看来你们中最好的人也就那么回事。
6192354999871977 什么泥魔女？
6192354999871978 为什么是外乡人？
6192354999871976 人们变得疯狂……像受惊吓的孩子。他们如此期望抓住某人，任何人，但对抓谁毫无头绪。有人说是外乡人。其他人说是个刹那。当它击中要害，人们很快就把泥魔女从记忆的深处拖了出来。
6192354999871980 是的，我知道有关的事。
6192354999871981 我想不起来了。
6192354999871979 一个刹那-艾丹。大草原传说里的东西。
6192354999871983 胡说八道。 无稽之谈。
6192354999871984 你认为是一个刹那杀死了父亲?
6192354999871982 大地是活的。剧变之中、忿怒、痛苦、恐惧、焦虑——这一切都在大地的肚子里生长而出，直到有一天它吐出一个泥土和死骨组成的生物。\n它经常看起来像个女人。它在我们中间走得越久，就越像一个活人。
6192354999871986 你这么想的？
6192354999871987 人们什么都能做得出来。父亲...以前...常这样说。
6192354999871985 也许凶手是个刹那？还能有数以？人是不可能做出这种事的。
6192354999871989 明显他们现在会去杀人。
6192354999871990 也许你是对的。
6192354999871991 扯淡。
6192354999871988 伊西多是个人，人不能够杀人，也不会去杀死人。至少在这个小镇是这样。
6192354999871993 我知道，但我会找出来的。
6192354999871994 还有一个…刹那？老实说，你几乎不比一群孩子强。
6192354999871992 还有谁？
6192354999871996 萨普洛夫？所以现在他管事？
6192354999871997 权势滔天的领导，嗯？
6192354999871995 哦，但他当然不是 <i>被杀了</i> 。——人们对格里夫很生气，所以他们只会不停重复胡说八道。还有， 萨普洛夫，他简直高兴得懒得搭理这些谣言。我的话，他会用自己的爪子会在这个案子里深深地挖掘来炫耀他的价值，记住我的话。
6192354999871999 所以现在他在炫耀他的价值？
6192354999872000 我父亲的遗体在哪？
6192354999871998 说是还是不是呢...真正的统治者是大维拉德。 金钱的力量，和小镇的生意都属于奥吉姆斯基。工厂，屠宰场，铁路，都归他所有。\n 凯恩家族掌管着恐惧。而萨普洛夫，从实际意义上而言仍是三大家族的首领，不过也仅限于此。
6192354999872002 哪里？
6192354999872001 可不是嘛。显然不是谋杀。但他下令逮捕任何可疑的人,哪怕是一丁点。如果我是你，我就不会去找萨普洛夫了……\n不过，确实是他拿走了钥匙。而且你可能还想向你父亲表示最后的敬意。他被萨普洛夫的手下带走了。
6192354999872004 是的，我在镇上有一些朋友。三个，至少，他们会帮助我的。
6192354999872005 我会去找萨普洛夫。尽管，考虑到这些...这可能不是个好主意。
6192354999872006 我哪也不去。我回家了。 
6192354999872003 没有线索。以前人们把死者带给你父亲…你知道，一个医生。我们现在怎么生活？不知道。\n难以置信。战争，火车的延迟…真是糟糕的一年！你现在有地方住吗？
6192355000183655 好吧...也许不是他们所有人。不过肯定有人会的，对吧？
6192355000183656 他们会的。
6192355000183657 其中一个肯定忘记了。
6192355000183654 你认为他们还记得你吗？毕竟已经六年了。 
6192354999936863 旁观者
6192354999872008 你为什么会觉得我是个医生？
6192354999872009 谁生病了？
6192354999872010 So you've found the murderer, huh? And I've heard there will be a trial?
6192354999872007 Look! See, everyone? The doctor is here!
6192354999872012 Tell me about your problem.
6192354999872011 我们从早上开始就在找医生。一个成年人来这里还有什么别的原因？
6192354999872014 Three kids are dead and no one gives a damn?!
6192354999872015 I've been asking myself that question all day…
6192354999940167 What happened?
6192354999872013 太迟了！他们死了！你为什么不早点来？<i>你是哪种医生？</i>
6192354999872017 谁毒死了他们？
6192354999872018 I'm sorry to hear that. I'm a dog person myself.
6192354999872019 Ugh! And here I was thinking…
6192354999872016 Not kids. Worse. Those were our dogs. Alma, Wolfling, and Duke…
6192354999872021 Well, at least I made it in time for the trial. Not all is lost.
6192354999872022 Oh, come on. This is a waste of my time.
6192354999872020 某个邪恶的人。诺克金正计划举行审判……他也想让你也在场。
6192354999872024 Where are they?
6192354999872023 Of course we did. Took us two hours.
6192354999872026 What about the victims? I was told someone was poisoned?
6192354999872027 Is 诺克金 the one on the crate? Got it, thanks.
6192354999872025 问诺克金。他在等你。 Said it's trial first, punishment after.
6192354999940169 Who did it?
6192354999940170 Oh… That's a shame.
6192354999940168 Our Halves got poisoned. The doggies. Alma, Duke, and Wolfling.
6192354999872029 Huh! So I have a living, breathing witness…
6192354999872030 Well, I hope he turns this undying legend into a song when he grows up.
6192355000302352 谁是利卡？
6192355000302353 哦，你是说我在车站看到的那个好心的狗狗男孩？他的名字是利卡，嗯？
6192354999872028 顺便说一句，那个叛徒利卡今天早上看见你了。你怎么下火车，把那些暴徒打得一塌糊涂…
6192354999872032 We'll see about that.
6192354999872033 Yeah? How come?
6192354999872031 Not for long. He's doomed.
6192354999872035 你们不需要先确定他是真正的罪犯吗？这是经验之谈。
6192354999872036 Not so fast. I need him to confirm my alibi first.
6192354999872037 And not only them, it seems. No way. I'll punish him myself.
6192354999872034 He killed Duke, Wolfling, and Alma. 诺克金 will punish him for that.
6192354999936861 Snout
6192354999936869 信使
6192354999872079 我宁愿冒此风险。
6192354999872080 为什么？
6192354999872078 不要进去，伙计。否则的话你就出不来了。 
6192354999872082 什么鸟？
6192354999872083 一个诗人啊。难怪没人抓你。 
6192354999872081 虽然…至少他们会把你送进监狱。你有机会休养生息，直到鸟儿停止尖叫返回巢中。
6192354999872085 我知道我犯有什么罪行，这不是他需要担心的。
6192354999872086 感谢建议。
6192354999872084 因为萨普洛夫会直接抓住你，然后才调查你的罪行，就像他对其他人做的一样。
6192354999872088 我知道。北方也一样歇斯底里。
6192354999872089 是的，我记得。我们小镇就是这样。
6192354999872087 人们就像群鸟。当大地震动或风嚎叫时，它们会吓一跳，发出嘎嘎声。有些鸟会害怕，而另一些鸟则会不断一遍一遍地重复……什么时候开始的？为什么？风从哪里吹来？什么时候结束？没人决定。鸟群不会思考，它只是倾听，只听自己的声音。
6192354999936862 耳语者
6192354999872091 为什么？
6192354999872092 你需要什么，大爷？
6192354999872093 我没有学位。战争剥夺了我毕业的机会。
6192354999872090 …所以你是个受训练的外科医生？好...非常好。遗憾的是你受人尊敬的学位对我来说毫无作用。
6192354999872095 一个menkhu… 这个词对你们这群人还有意义吗？
6192354999872094 金族人还没有接纳你。你是布拉克的儿子，但是血缘是不够的。假设你刚生下来就是menkhu但事实上你不是。\n你去天晓得什么地方学习，将你的人民抛在脑后。老家伙们不会欣赏这种事的。金族人会彻底接纳你吗？
6192354999872097 是的，准则。
6192354999872098 这些都是一个将死之人的古老信仰。没人会把它们当真了。
6192355000995051 真的？你看起来像是个大草原居民。你是谁？ 
6192354999872096 我不是大草原居民。但是我知道在你们这种，只有menkhus可以成为屠夫，智者或外科医生。因为他们知晓准则。\n你们用的是这个词吧？理解世界的艺术？准则？ 
6192354999872100 能不能把不要提我父亲！
6192354999872101 父亲… 非常迷恋传统。但是过去的事，已经过去了。
6192354999872099 你的父亲是这样。在各种意义上都是个聪明的人。不仅仅是个医生，一个真正的智者。
6192354999872103 怎么个更好法？
6192354999872104 不，老头，这一点也不好。我是个无名小卒。 
6192354999872102 那更好。
6192354999872106 我为什么帮不上忙？
6192354999872107 我也不带伞这么做。
6192354999872105 该怎么说呢？我有一个特殊的需求。但是现在老布拉克死了，没人可以帮得上我忙。包括他的儿子。也无法提供帮助。
6192354999872109 你到底是谁？
6192354999872110 别给我添麻烦，老人。我自己已经受够了。
6192355001008857 没错，你是那个会买血的人。我想起了。我只是好奇你需要什么样的帮助。
6192354999872108 …这就是为什么你和我没什么好说的。你可能知道如何使用手术刀，但你不知道准则。\n 在这个小镇上，没有人会信任你切开身体，在你足够了解世界的之前。所以你帮不了我。
6192354999872112 哪种生意？
6192354999872113 你一定是问错人了。我从小就知道坏格里夫，没有他打不破的底线。所以和他谈谈，而不是我。
6192354999872111 我是老瓦。我做某种...生意。不寻常的生意。你的父亲从前提供..特殊的货物给我。\n现在我来找坏格里夫帮忙……他是个强盗，无法无天。但事实证明，他太过胆小，无法跨越这个特定的界限…
6192354999872115 ...什么用途？
6192354999872114 我买血。还有器官。身体成分，人体成分。
6192354999872117 已经忘了。
6192354999872118 告诉我你住哪，我想和你多聊一聊关于金族的事。
6192355001141181 好吧。过些时候我会到你家来谈金族的事。
6192354999872116 你不是menkhu。你不会明白的，忘了它吧。 
6192354999872120 是的。你认识他吗？
6192354999872121 不。我是来给你带点东西的，老头。这是你需要的吗？
6192354999872119 啊...是你。你是来谈关于你父亲的事吗?
6192354999872123 我是个大胆的人。所以你是要还是不要？
6192354999872124 我没有你想的那么匆忙。首先，告诉我你为什么需要这个……
6192354999872122 所以你敢…但你还没准备好。你想把马车放在马前面。这会给你带来麻烦。
6192354999872126 我听得很清楚，老头。老瓦, is it?
6192354999872127 但是我得快点。瞧，我带给你了点东西。
6192354999872125 药的。但这并不是像你这样一个笨手笨脚的人应该思考的问题。你小时候离开这个小镇。你从来都不了解它，现在连那些残片都丢了，也忘了。教育你自己。在充满蓷薾气息的空气中呼吸。去了解长辈们吧。\n不要着急，布拉克，获得尊重。那你就有答案了。6192354999872129 Then you can't have the goods.
6192354999872130 我需要钱。拿着。
6192354999872128 我不会的。你还不是真正的menkhu。你不会明白的。\n如果你选择仓促行事，我没资格评判。我接受货物。但教育你不是我的工作。
6192355001007852 Got it, you spider of a man. See you.
6192355001007853 你住在药店。一家商店里。我有权来这里。
6192355001007851 是的，是的。只不过我不是老人。我是一个没有时间闲聊的人，hates it when people clutter their room for now reason.\n当你吃肉的时候再来找我。
6192354999872135 这地方问起来一股血腥味。
6192354999872136 我是阿泰米·布拉克.
6192354999872134 你是谁?你想要什么？
6192354999872138 恰好经过而已。
6192354999872139 嘴巴放干净点，老头。我是布拉克之子。
6192354999872137 布拉克死了。你他妈想要什么，不知道姓什么的阿泰米？
6192354999872141 我自己一个人来的。
6192354999872142 我是伊西多·布拉克之子。
6192354999872140 谁派你来的？
6192354999872144 你要买吗？
6192354999872143 你给我来血来了吗，伊西多·布拉克之子？
6192354999872146 这些天你对什么货物感兴趣？
6192354999872147 看来滚蛋是我的最好选择。
6192354999872145 给我货物，或者给我滚。
6192354999872151 How much?
6192354999872149 Huh… That's some unusual trade you have.
6192354999872150 Got it. I'll be sure to drop by if I have any.
6192354999872152 I think I'll tell on you leeches to the governor. Then again, you two probably conspire.
6192354999872148 鲜血， 肾脏，脾脏，心脏。放在冰上不要超过两百分钟。 不要试图忽悠我，
6192354999872154 Fair enough.
6192354999872155 These things don't come cheap.
6192354999872153 I'll tell you when I see it.
6192355001141183 只不过顺路经过。
6192355001141184 嘴巴放干净点，老头。 I did nothing to provoke this attack.
6192355001141182 你他妈想要什么，不请自来的阿泰米？ 
6192355000531309 鲁宾 made a cure for the sand pest, and he made it from strange blood. And you know a lot about blood.
6192355000531308 So you say you know how to connect things… which is why you cut, rip, and break them. Just like your 父亲.
6192355000531313 My 父亲's apprentice. Didn't he come to you?
6192355000531314 A friend of mine. So you don't know him…
6192355000531312 鲁宾… 谁是鲁宾?
6192355000531316 No. That was special blood. Human won't do.
6192355000531317 Fat chance. Blood's only getting cheaper these days.
6192355000531315 Lots of idiots found their way into 伊西多's circle. Although I guess not all of them were completely stupid…\nSo he made a cure, huh? You sure? From blood? So its price will rise…
6192355000531319 Like she needs you… Tell me, has anyone ever brought you unusual blood?
6192355000531320 I won't tell on you. And in return, you'll tell me where to find the most unusual blood in this town.
6192355000531318 A cure, huh… You're a big talker.\nWhat does a smartass like you want from me? Advice? Here: if you tell on me to that unholy wench, I'll claw my way out of hell to drag you back down with me. Got it?
6192355000531322 Well?
6192355000531323 你笑什么？
6192355000531321 No. Although…
6192355000531325 我在问一个严肃的问题，而你却当成笑话。该死...
6192355000531327 You know what? I'll pay them a visit.
6192355000531324 草药新娘s dance with the earth at the Ear. Did you know? To make twyre bloom better. Cover themselves in some sort of mud that they call blood.\nYou can probably pick its sample there if you want. I bet you haven't yet tried to brew a cure from mud, huh? Ha ha ha…
6192355001193254 Huh?
6192355001203851 What did you call me?
6192355001193253 Getting the taste of it, huh, ripper?
6192355001203853 Huh?
6192355001203852 What would you have me call you? A haruspex?
6192355001203855 Do you know that your neighbor has a side job?
6192355001203858 Actually, I know a brilliant joke about it. A dentist, a surgeon, and a veterinarian walk into a dissecting room...
6192355001203854 Well, you brought me more human organs, didn't you? Or did you just drop by for a chat?
6192355001203857 One day they'll bust you both.
6192355001203861 Well... God be with you, kind people.
6192355001203856 He's just helping people, like me. It's called "compassion." As for his methods, they're none of my business. I stay out of his, he stays out of mine, that's how we stay good neighbors.\nI suggest you do the same.
6192355001203860 All right, how about a newer one? So there is this chemist who embalms the dead...
6192355001203859 Stale.
6192355001203863 I've nothing to hide.
6192355001203864 If I'm busted, I'll know whom to thank for it.
6192355001203862 Mind your own safety.
6192355001457052 我到这儿不是来找你。我是来找你的药剂师，但是他不在。所以我没有别的人可以瞅了。
6192355001459459 药剂师被逮捕了吗？
6192355001457051 我不是个跳舞的，所以不要再瞅我了。有事快说。
6192355001459452 药剂师怎么了？
6192355001459456 Not selling it.
6192355001459451 保持沉默，小鸟。. Off, preferably. I'm buying! Hahaha…
6192355001459455 你刚才是不是称我是告密者？
6192355001459460 他的行为威胁到我们所有人！你看不出来吗？
6192355001459465 你怎么知道是我。
6192355001459454 不知道。 我可不是告密者。你告诉我药剂师什么了！不过我不在乎。 
6192355001459464 不。问这些人如同大海捞针。
6192355001459466 你真是个王八蛋。
6192355001459463 Oh, don't mind me.想知道他在哪？问问带走他的人。我什么都不知道。就算是我做的，我也不会告诉一个内奸。所以滚回你的老鼠窝去，我很忙。 
6192354999922852 老瓦
6192354999872157 How fares your kine, Khatangher?
6192354999872158 Bayarlaa, 谢谢你。为什么我父亲还没有被埋葬？
6192354999872156 Emshen，勇者。他的精神是顽强的。How fares your kine，emshen？Bite kharaan,因为他来向他的父亲献上最后致敬。我们也是。
6192354999872160 我是来向父亲献上最后敬意的。为什么我要看这些？ 
6192354999872159 Bite kharaan, ubshe即将开始。损失很大。需要说话，说出正确的话。观察仪式。Bite kharaan, ubshe is at the threshold. The loss is great. A need to speak, to say the words correct. Observe the rite.
6192354999872162 我不是为了他的使命而来。我需要检查他的伤口。
6192354999872163 Be khara,这可不容易。他欠下了什么? 
6192354999872164 在金族和大地眼前，这就是我要说的：我，他的儿子，接受他的使命，如同我自己的使命。天空是我的见证。
6192354999872161 Khodo khara，布拉克 -esegher承受了很大的负担。欠了很大的债。谁会承担他的职责？
6192354999872166 Bayartai, khyn. 谢谢你。
6192354999872167 Bayarlaa. 我会做必须被完成的事。我别无选择。 
6192354999872168 是的。我刚做出了一个勇敢的举动。
6192354999872165 为你鞠躬, emshen. The first blood yours. Be khara, emshen是个男人，勇敢的男人。\n萨巴站在这里, Sabha Usp'tae. 你已经接替了他的使命。现在，继承他的遗产。萨巴会展现给你的。
6192354999872170 Be tatgalzah. I don't. I can't.
6192354999872171 在金族和大地眼前，这就是我要说的：我，他的儿子，接受他的使命，如同我自己的使命。天空是我的见证。
6192355000597152 不。等等。我要先看一眼他的遗体。
6192354999872169 你错了，emshen。你错了。是khara，你不知道你的意思，所以你欢迎错误的客人。现在说吧：你接受他自己的职责吗？
6192354999872173 Be tatgalzah. I don't. I can't.
6192354999872174 在金族和大地眼前，这就是我要说的：我，他的儿子，接受他的使命，如同我自己的使命。天空是我的见证。
6192354999872175 等等。我要先看一眼他的遗体。
6192354999872172 他没告诉我们，emshen;他把它带到了坟墓。你问错了人。太晚了，emshen，现在。大地在等待。现在说吧：你会接受他的使命吗？
6192354999872177 随意。我只是想结束这些，
6192354999872178 ...不，这不对。在金族和大地眼前，这就是我要说的：我，他的儿子，接受他的使命，如同我自己的使命。天空为我见证。
6192354999872176 Be khara, emshen is cautious. Who is it will judge him? 如果大地不愿意接受布拉克-esegher, 让我们烧了他吧。
6192354999872180 在这里等我。
6192354999872179 很多人马上就要离开了。赶紧，emshen.
6192354999872182 Be tatgalzah. 我不会，我不能。
6192354999872183 在金族和大地眼前，这就是我要说的：我，他的儿子，接受他的使命，如同我自己的使命。天空为我见证。
6192355000597151 在等一等。不久我会表达我的内心。
6192354999872181 在等着你呢，现在说吧：你愿意承担他所欠下的吗？ 
6192355000012651 
6192355000795253 Kindred One
6192354999872213 父亲!你能听到我说话吗？
6192354999872212 ...它必须完成，残酷的举动。但是必要的。一个inoculation.
6192354999872215 父亲！是谁杀了你？
6192354999872216 父亲，你欠下了什么？为什么大地驱逐你？ 
6192354999872217 父亲，你在和谁说话？是我，阿泰米。你的儿子。
6192354999872214 ......不需要懊恼，也无需悔过。五年前，我就应该完成的，在第一次爆发的时候。我不够勇敢。它像野火一样蔓延开来。
6192354999872219 你在和其他某个人说话...
6192354999872220 我今天做了正确的事吗？我选择了正确的道路吗？ 
6192354999872221 我很抱歉我来晚了。我尝试了，但...还不够。对不起。
6192354999872218 也不需要害怕。对于一个男人，或者城镇而言，死亡并不是最糟糕的命运。要获得生存的权利，必须先通过死亡的审判。我最近才意识到这一点，但这是真的。告诉金族人。 Death is not the worst fate for a man, nor a town, for that matter. To earn their right to live, one must first pass the trial of death. I have only recently realized that, but it's true. Tell that to the Kin.
6192354999872223 你在说什么？
6192354999872224 五年前发生了什么？
6192354999872225 You don't need to explain yourself to anyone!
6192354999872222 ......这将是困难的，也是可怕的。对于那些未能通过审判的人，我感到心痛。有些人会死。很多人会。然而，我们无法继续以旧的方式生活。我们与动物有什么不同？那是自然之道：适者生存。…It will be difficult, and terrible. My heart aches for those who will fail the trial. Some will die. Many will. And yet, we couldn't keep living the old way. How did we differ from animals? That's nature: Only the strong survive.
6192354999872227 Just know that I… I respect you, and love you.
6192354999872228 我不会让你失望的。
6192354999872229 原谅我。
6192354999872226 ......是的，这听起来很残忍。开始战争和改革国家的暴君所说的话语。但我们谈的是自然。我们不能只是敲门时锁门。我们必须面对它，证明我们有权在这片土地上生活。…Yes, it sounds cruel. The words of tyrants who start wars and reform countries. But we're talking about nature. We can't just lock the door when it knocks. We must face it, proving our right to live on this earth.
6192354999872231 The rest is silence.
6192354999872232 ...好的，我明白了。
6192354999872233 Indeed, there won't be.
6192354999872230 ...特别是因为没有休息......永远不会。…Especially since there will be no rest… Not ever.
6192355000332951 伊西多·布拉克
6192354999872235 What's going on?
6192354999872236 What do you mean, no loitering? This is my house!
6192354999872237 Was there another murder?
6192354999872234 Hey, big guy! No loitering. Keep walking.
6192354999872239 What's this stuff in the air?
6192354999872240 Go to 萨普洛夫 for help? I'd rather go to hell.
6192354999872238 By the order of Governor 萨普洛夫, entrance is by permit only. If you want in so badly, go to the 城镇大厅 and get one.
6192354999872242 So you think this is factory soot, huh?
6192354999872243 Something stinks here.
6192354999872244 Accident or not, let me in!
6192354999872241 I bet there was an accident at the plant. A fire, or a pipe burst, who knows…Now all this soot is pouring out, and the plant is dead in the water.\nExplains why the Termitary's on lockdown when there isn't any work to do. No sense in letting them roam the streets. An accident—what else could it be?
6192354999872246 I need to get inside.
6192354999872245 Take a look at this grimy air. 史迪奇 and thick, like snot… If I were you I'd get out of here right now. Me and my pal have been standing here for a couple hours already, and we're sick as hell from it. Damned shift change can't come soon enough.
6192354999872248 You can rot here for all I care.
6192354999872249 I have better things to do.
6192354999872247 Come back with a stamped permit from 萨普洛夫 and we'll let you in. While you're at it, get him to send in another shift!
6192355000776968 Keep standing guard, I've got nothing.
6192355000776969 Don't fret, I've got a paper from 萨普洛夫.
6192355000776967 你想要什么？
6192355000776971 Don't worry, I've seen worse.
6192355000776972 I'm not scared of a little dirt.
6192355000776970 Got your hands on a permit, huh? Go on in then, it's your funeral.
6192355000274051 Patrolman
6192354999872257 What trouble?
6192354999872258 It's not in my power.
6192354999872256 Now everyone acknowledges you. Everyone says you have embarked upon the path of your 父亲.\nMake it so they unlock the Termitary. Bite kharaan, something's off about it. Trouble must be brewing.
6192354999872260 Make who? Fat 维拉德? He won't listen.
6192354999872261 Gonna ask me to grant three wishes, too?
6192354999872259 We don't know. Make them tell us. Make them open the Termitary.
6192354999872263 I'm not a menkhu yet, but I'm working on it.
6192354999872264 Menkhu? What does that mean?
6192354999872265 When will I be allowed to do that?
6192354999872262 Everyone says you're now a menkhu. Once you're allowed to cut bodies, cut my brother, please. Release him of evil meat, so he may speak.
6192354999872267 When I know everything, your grandchildren will be grandparents.
6192354999872266 How can you not know? Be khara, you're laughing at me. A menkhu knows the body's Lines. A menkhu knows the composition of everything.
6192354999872269 Sure.
6192354999872270 If I myself live to see that fine moment.
6192354999872268 The elders will say when. Can we bring my brother to you? Will you cut away his pain?
6192354999872272 I will. Bring her here when her water breaks.
6192354999872273 Where did you all even come from…
6192354999872271 You were unjustly suspected yesterday, but now everyone believes you. My sister is about to give birth. The older women say the child is big, she is small, and so she will die if not helped. Will you help her?
6192355000441151 Respectful One
6192354999872275 What do you want, a password?
6192354999872276 I'm here to speak to 可汗.
6192354999872274 Hate to break it to ya, big fella, but we don't let just anyone in.
6192354999872278 Ask away.
6192354999872279 Go ahead. I could use one of those lately.
6192354999872277 Nah, no passwords. All I want is an answer to a simple question. No strings attached.
6192354999872281 Obviously.
6192354999872282 Is this a joke? I'm almost thirty.
6192354999872280 Are you older than eighteen?
6192354999872284 That's a bit harsh, don't you think?
6192354999872285 At least tell me… What's inside?
6192354999872286 I'm looking for a kid who goes by "可汗."
6192354999872283 Just as I thought. Fuck off, big fella. We're sixteen and under here. Tried to cut you a little slack what with your size, but this won't do.
6192354999872288 So, the Tower is chock full of kids?
6192354999872287 Those are the rules. The Tower is all ours, no adults allowed.
6192354999872290 Wanted to meet him.
6192354999872291 Important business.
6192354999872292 It's him who wants to meet me, not the other way around.
6192354999872289 可汗? What do you want with him?
6192354999872294 Got me there. Never been a good liar.
6192354999872295 I'm not getting in, am I?
6192354999872293 We'd know if he wanted to see you. Know why you're all grown up? 'cause you forgot how to lie! There's an art to it.
6192354999872297 What do you even do in there?
6192354999872298 Holy shit! Are you sure it won't fall?
6192354999872296 We got some space left. There's only seven hundred of us.
6192354999872300 To hell with these games. Tell 可汗 I said hi.
6192354999872301 Whatever. See you weirdos later.
6192354999872299 You're asking too many questions.
6192355000441153 Watchdog
6192355000795254 Patches
6192354999872324 为什么？
6192354999872325 Let me through. I have the right to be here.
6192354999872326 I live there.
6192354999872323 This place is on lockdown. Move along.
6192354999872328 I need to talk to a certain girl. 塔雅 泰吉. Do you know her?
6192354999872329 Come on, let me in.
6192354999872327 你想要什么？
6192354999872331 Maybe we can strike a deal? A hundred coins, right now.
6192354999872332 Maybe I am.
6192354999872330 If you want to bother someone, go do it at the pub. Or are you looking for trouble? We can help you out.
6192354999872334 Whatever.
6192354999872335 Fat 维拉德, huh? There's a thought.
6192354999872333 Go ahead and offer them to Fat 维拉德 if you're so smart. He's got plenty of room for coins. The man shits money. As for me, I like my head attached to my shoulders, thank you very much. So get out of here. Enough talk.
6192354999872337 Why are they screaming?
6192354999872338 I'd hate to have your job.
6192354999872336 We're not paid to ask questions. We're paid to stop people going in and out.
6192354999872340 This isn't the end of it.
6192354999872341 Keep your shirt on, 士兵. Don't want to lose it.
6192354999872339 Move along.
6192354999872343 No means no. Got it.
6192354999872344 Why are they screaming?
6192354999872342 The orders were clear—no one's getting in under any circumstances.
6192355000900153 为什么？
6192355000900152 What's going on here?
6192355000901751 Got it.
6192355000900151 Where do you think you're going? Can't you see it's locked?
6192355000901752 I see.
6192355000900155 Watch your tongue, tough guy.
6192355000900154 None of our business. And none of yours. The orders are not to let anyone in.
6192355000441154 Guard
6192354999872346 Sand pest?
6192354999872347 Did I faint?
6192354999872345 You got yourself infected with sand pest, Cub. Our dogs found you.
6192354999872349 Five years ago, you say…?
6192354999872351 …So what, do you want to play more?
6192355001519660 "The plague game," my ass…
6192354999872348 Sand pest. That's what it's like. It struck once before, five years ago. A lot of people died. We used to play the plague game then, too…
6192354999872356 Like leprosy?
6192354999872357 Uh huh. Next you're going to tell me madness is contagious.
6192354999872355 It's deadly… Spreads like fire. Transmitted through touch. It infects items. Walls, drawers. The ground itself. It clings to you like mud…
6192354999872359 I've seen that air.
6192354999872360 Unlikely. Few diseases are transmitted both ways.
6192354999872358 It's in the air, too. If a sick person touches you, you can catch it. It's like smoke… Like a fog. If you breathe in infected air, you might get sick.
6192354999872363 What about you?
6192355000270051 Who's 诺克金?
6192355001583950 Aren't you a bit too young to play with 诺克金's gang?
6192354999872361 Here, have an immunity pill. So that you don't faint anymore. All right? 诺克金 gave us some, but you need it more.\nIt suppresses all kinds of diseases. It also tingles on your tongue.
6192354999872369 Fine. Hand your pills over.
6192355001492452 You do look like a healthy lad.
6192354999872367 We're small. A single pill can last me a day. But I'm actually very healthy—my belly never even aches!
6192355000270053 I see… We used to have our own hideout over there when we were kids, too.
6192355001589357 Aren't you a bit too young to play in the Warehouses?
6192355000270052 The leader of the Soul-and-a-Halves. Everyone knows us. Our headquarters is in the Warehouses.
6192355001492456 A spot-on description of my overall condition.
6192355001583949 What happened to me?
6192355001492455 Yeah. You were lying down, not moving at all. Like a corpse…
6192355001583941 Have I fainted?
6192355001583942 The air was all black…
6192355001583940 Something bad happened to you, Cub. You got sick, I think. Our dogs found you on the ground.
6192355001583944 And Mom?
6192355001583945 Well, he's not wrong…
6192355001583943 It's emission from the Factory. \nDad says they only used to pollute the water, but now the air's poison too, and life is suffering, and the Pig is a bloodsucker and worse.
6192355001583947 Five years ago, huh…
6192355001583948 Well. Thanks for rescuing me.
6192355001583946 Mom says nothing. Just keeps praying. Aunt Dora said she saw the same stuff five years ago.
6192355001589352 And what is your Half? A little grass snake?
6192355001589353 Fair enough. Thanks for the pills.
6192355001589351 My Half chose me when I was three. It's their choice, not ours.
6192355001589355 She's just shy.
6192355001589356 Don't worry. She'll show herself.
6192355001589354 A chaffinch. Only I haven't seen her in a year.

6192354999936866 匹斯沃克
6192354999937852 太忙了……但说到饥饿，你有什么吃的吗？我会为一些干巴巴的老吐司宰掉一个人…
6192354999937877 你运气真不好。幸运的是，我不像你，我几乎没有挨饿。
6192354999937851 终于！一群人聚集在我的表演周围！坐下来——现在看着我的表演：饥饿至死！
6192354999937870 没关系。我再找一个有烤面包的怪人。
6192354999937869 好心得先生想吃一片吗？来一片！不会持久的，半小时后，我的表演又开始了。来看看：饥饿至死，小伙子们和姑娘们！
6192354999937872 我尊重他人的财产。
6192354999937873 事实上，这不是个坏主意。我认为你的“表演”可能会被推迟，毕竟。
6192354999937871 大错特错！你应该找些交易垃圾的怪人。也许有家可住的怪人太愚蠢了，你在他们微不足道的东西中可以找到意想不到的价值。
6192354999937875 …我想我该走了。谢谢你的吐司，怪人。
6192354999937876 有道理……那我能要个开锁工具吗？
6192354999937874 所以呢？那么，我们的观众很快就会欣赏到我们的戏剧：饥饿至死！布拉克，你现在能感觉到他们饥饿的眼神吗？
6192354999937854 别犯傻了。<i>我</i> 才是要渴死的人。
6192354999937857 …那就喝点水？
6192354999937853 这种口渴一直驱使着我走向死亡。
6192354999937859 继续。我想知道结局如何。
6192354999937864 这表演烂透了。我不是那种情绪化的人。
6192354999937858 真的，看我把你的命运表演出来，亲爱的傻瓜。”救命！有人帮帮忙！我很快就会渴死的。”
6192354999937861 谢谢你的瓶子，傻子。
6192354999937868 没有你荒谬的建议，我也处理得了。
6192354999937860 你死了，我的朋友，这就是结局。水到处都是。尽管水洼是不好的饮料：从喷泉口，从水桶中啜饮。你只需要一个瓶子。给你一个。
6192354999937863 我也是...
6192354999937862 我没有水，先生！你看我是怎么受苦的，不知道怎么解决。
6192354999937866 我不知道。
6192354999937867 某人—不是我!—gets a good kick.
6192354999937865 不？这很难说，对你而言。但如果你觉得自己很聪明，那就说：接下来会发生什么？
6192354999937856 我不擅长猜谜。
6192354999937878 I意思是你需要睡觉。
6192354999937855 …我发现自己筋疲力尽。很快就要倒下了！他们说，“”太累了“。我想知道这是什么意思？
6192354999937880 睡会觉。
6192354999937881 Surprise me.
6192354999937879 当你的疲劳达到顶峰的时候，死亡便会悄然而至。但怎么能逃脱如此悲惨的命运呢？
6192354999937883 我也是。
6192354999937884 这个镇上有没有供无家可归的穷人居住的破屋吗？
6192354999937882 但我有祸了，因为我没有地方睡觉！在这个低微的悲剧演员面前，房门紧锁。在他的家乡，现在不受欢迎。
6192354999937886 …谢谢。你也是。
6192354999937892 你说得对…我得回家了。赶紧的。
6192355000182465 不需要……我已经去过那里了。
6192354999937885 回家吧，布拉克！休息对你有好处。但如果你找到别人的床：快去偷偷睡觉。甜蜜的梦，不幸的探索者。
6192354999937888 我死后才会长眠，我猜。
6192354999937889 一个开锁器能让我进去的，如果我能弄到一个的话...
6192354999937887 谁知道？但是你，布拉克，不仅仅是流浪汉。像你这样的英雄是不会被放进来的。
6192354999937891 什么？
6192354999937890 我为你准备好了。在这儿；来一发。还是…
6192355000782252 我用不着钱。这里似乎用它什么都不能买。
6192355000782253 …当然。非常感谢你把它还给我。
6192355000782254 这是某种性格测试吗？
6192355000782251 先生，这是你的钱吗？我想你的钱包掉了。
6192355000782256 你这么认为吗？
6192355000782262 啊，就是我要找的那种地方。
6192355000782255 唉，今天不是做生意的日子。来自外地的可疑之人是法外之徒。但是有一家商店买卖赃物，就在仓库区中间，与各种各样的人进行交易，不顾及你的声誉。\n 你可能会发现钱的用途的。
6192355000782258 的确，它们是人最好的朋友…
6192355000782263 我宁愿用以物换物获得我需要的东西。
6192355000782264 谢谢，黑衣人。
6192355000782257 先生，您是应该恢复您的声誉，还是希望通过盗窃和抢劫重新将其毁灭？不！当然，你不会的。\n 但要相信交易；因为硬币可不会记得自己是从哪里来的。
6192355000782260 我明白了，一个乐观主义者。
6192355000782261 你确定吗？
6192355000782265 鉴于现在的情况，我不知道该拿它怎么办。
6192355000782259 省点钱，先生。你还需要它。
6192355000062551 提词人
6192354999937894 他妈的。这里每个人都想让我死吗？
6192354999937897 我…明白了。能详细解释一下吗，猴男？
6192354999937893 安静点！他一定不能听不到你的声音，靠近一点……他只会说谎，想让你死！
6192354999937899 让我猜猜……父亲对我不高兴，是吗？
6192354999937900 对。有三个。我们小时候是形影不离的。
6192354999937898 别回家，布拉克。远离家。在镇子上，你还有些朋友，不是吗？
6192354999937902 避免厄运不是我的风格。
6192354999937903 我在家，小家伙。我会留在这里。
6192354999937901 不高兴？远非如此。但我还是要说：别回家，我求求你。注意我的话，说真的，避免你的厄运，布拉克。
6192354999938079 闭上眼睛，藏在下面。没人能伤害你。
6192354999938080 我会记住你说的话的。
6192354999938078 这个小镇是你的，布拉克。希望你能很快发现它的根有多深，从你的脊椎往下延伸得多深。愿你居住在它的毛孔里。学习静脉、动脉、神经、血液和细胞。\n你不需要在城镇之外的家。忘记你如此渴望寻找的地方。我请求你的宽恕；如果我告诉你更多的话，我会受到严重的伤害。

6192354999948852 I need to talk to the governor.
6192354999948855 I need to go to the toilet.
6192354999948858 Look, you're obviously not an uncharitable man. Maybe you'd like a bit more in your pocket?
6192354999948851 Okay, I'm gonna explain how this works, and you're gonna listen.\nAll suspects get locked up while investigation is ongoing. That'll happen in the morning. You can scream, shout, run around in circles, bang on doors all you want—morning is when you get out, and not a moment sooner. You've got food and water. Now wait.
6192354999948854 Listen, pal. Do you know who I am?
6192354999948865 Do you even get to sleep tonight?
6192355000937872 Tell the governor I have a witness! They will confirm I'm innocent in my 父亲's death.
6192354999948853 If you need to, you will. In the morning.
6192354999948857 I really do.
6192354999948864 You can tie my hands if you don't trust me.
6192354999948856 I know you're lying. You don't need the bathroom. I can tell from your eyes. I'm a great judge of character.
6192354999948862 How much would it take?
6192354999948863 I don't feel good… I think I'm having a stroke. I need a doctor…
6192354999948861 Who wouldn't? But we can't take bribes. And you don't have anywhere near enough to make someone ignore their orders.
6192354999948867 I'm not that kind of person.
6192354999948868 …Yeah. Want to give me a hint?
6192354999948866 Do you think I'm stupid? I know what you're up to. It's called weaseling. You figure there must be a way out and you're trying to wind me up, find the right approach. Right?
6192354999948870 So what, 萨普洛夫's going to torture me?
6192354999948871 I don't have time to sleep, pal. I'm needed outside!
6192354999948872 My 父亲 is dead. And here you are…
6192354999948869 Look. You aren't coming out of that cell a moment before the order's given. Period. Except under a shroud, maybe. The walls and door won't break down, so don't even try it. \nYou've got a cot; use it. You'll want to be refreshed tomorrow for the investigation.
6192355000937874 A girl named 穆克.
6192355000937875 A strange kid named Lika. He wears a dog head.
6192355001131752 The driver of the train I arrived by.
6192355000937873 What kind of witness?
6192355000937877 They weren't given time.
6192355000937878 A child isn't a person?
6192355000937876 Who would trust a kid? They'd say anything for a peanut. And if you have witnesses, why were they silent before?
6192355001131754 Like… a normal person.
6192355001131755 Ordinary height. Ordinary complexion. Looks like a worker, maybe.
6192355001131756 …Like a good third of the Town's men. Damn it.
6192355001131753 Yeah? And what did he look like?
6192355001131758 …Damn it.
6192355001131757 So how do we look for him, I wonder? The normal, ordinary one?
6192354999948876 They got the culprit? Who is it?
6192354999948877 Finally.
6192354999948878 They got the culprit? Where are they?
6192354999948875 Turns out you're innocent. They got the culprit. Everyone else is free to go.
6192354999948880 What Master?
6192354999948883 I have no master.
6192354999948879 You think anyone tells me that kind of thing? If someone's free to go, they aren't a suspect anymore. Right? So the culprit must have been caught. It's called logic.\nAlthough… maybe they weren't. Not my place to know. My orders were to let the big one go. The Master vouched for you.
6192354999948882 All four of them? That's a rousing vote of confidence.
6192354999948884 Okay. So long, pal.
6192354999948881 Fat 维拉德. 维拉德 奥吉姆斯基, that is. The big one. 维拉德 Senior. 
6192354999964357 Prison Guard
6192354999948897 You think we have anything in common, odongh?
6192354999948898 Why are they so hateful?
6192354999948896 If you see a man, run. Men are angry today. They kill the likes of you and I.
6192354999948900 You're a worm, true. But I am human all right.
6192354999948901 Unfortunately, I am made of flesh and blood. So I'll take your advice.
6192354999948899 We're not human. We're different.
6192354999948903 What murderer? What does it have to do with me?
6192354999948904 I'll be cautious.
6192355000183651 But the earth doesn't.
6192354999948902 Looking for a murderer. Turning into murderers themselves. This is how a town changes.
6192354999948906 Thanks, Worm. Let Mother Boddho keep your footprints warm.
6192354999948907 I can't. I have business at the heart of the town.
6192354999948905 You look like a murderer. Do not delve into the town's flesh in you want to live. Keep to the outskirts. Less people here.
6192354999964351 Odongh
6192354999948909 Well?
6192354999948910 Great, a poet. Go ahead, I'm listening.
6192354999948911 God, no. Someone's on my tail.
6192354999948908 Oh my brothers, my brothers in spirits! Behold a man, head higher than the sky! Behold a creature of well-earned pride. Dare I trouble you, good sir, with trivial talk?
6192354999948913 Drink from the river, then.
6192354999948916 You're literally next to a pub.
6192354999948923 Yeah… Tough to find good water around here.
6192354999948912 Oh, how ferocious Mother Nature is! For 'tis her wrath that must be borne. Oh friend, if only I could quench my thirst… I'd give heaven and earth for a sip of cold water!
6192354999948915 The air <i>is</i> heady here in September.
6192354999948920 Yeah right. I didn't come halfway across the country to get you a drink from a barrel.
6192354999948921 You do actually seem about to faint. A stroke seems closer than the river.
6192354999948922 You're in luck. Have some of mine.
6192354999948914 Only brute beasts drink from the river. Us proud men deserve spring water. It is brought here in barrels, but they're too often empty. I would get it there, but I have no bottles. I'd drink from a fountain, but I might faint first… The air is far too heady.
6192354999948918 I don't. But the river is right there. You'll make it. I believe in you.
6192354999948919 Maybe I do.
6192354999948917 The pub is closed, good sir, but even if it wasn't… What makes it open, really? One must ask oneself… And anyway, 斯塔马丁 the Curmudgeonly has introduced new rules, with another sort of liquid flowing. A fiery one. A good one, but not one I need at the moment… \nSo, do you have water?
6192355000341754 Carouser
6192354999948925 Did you do this?
6192354999948926 Nothing. There's nothing more to be done.
6192354999948927 Why did you do that to her?
6192354999948924 …H-how? 为什么？ Curse this air, this mind-numbing odor… What do we do now?
6192355000937864 What bones? Can't you plainly see that it's a normal girl?
6192355000937865 How will you live with this, now?
6192354999948928 In the morning, people screamed about a steppe abomination, that it left no footprints and had bones for legs. \nBut now look: It's only a girl. A steppe girl, sure, but… alive.
6192355000937855 But what for?
6192355000937856 Why a steppe girl?
6192355000937854 No. It was a twyre-addled mob. The steppe is in bloom, and people get crazed… But never before was it <i>this</i> bad.
6192355000937858 Not a walk. A dance.
6192355000937859 Do people seriously still believe this?
6192355000937857 Old wives' tales… They claim a golem sometimes emerges from the ground. It looks like a woman, but is all earth, clay, rock, and marrow. The story claims it has legs of bone and this… uncanny way of walking.\nAnd the brides… You know they have a special walk, too.
6192355000937862 How long have people been this… crazed?
6192355000937863 You will. Our town is a small one.
6192355000937861 Us? It wasn't us who did this… unspeakable thing. We'd like to find the scum who did and lay them down next to the poor girl.
6192355000937868 Shrewd.
6192355000937867 Do people scream things like that often around here?
6192355000937866 Don't you know how it goes? "Get her!" one screams, and the rest crowd without hesitation… Especially in the night, especially with their minds intoxicated.\nNot everyone can think for themselves. It's easier to just do as you're told.
6192355000937870 Indeed.
6192355000937871 I can't believe my eyes.
6192355000937869 Have you been listening, lad? I'm telling you, this is the first time! The world must be coming to an end…
6192354999964358 Lost One
6192354999948936 I would never renounce my 父亲. I have nothing to be ashamed of.
6192354999948950 Any cracked ribs? Bones? Breathe in, out.
6192354999952151 And tomorrow, it'll be different somehow?
6192354999948935 You're a brave soul… as befits 伊西多's son, of course. It takes courage to claim your name today.
6192354999952153 Let me examine you. I'm a doctor.
6192354999952154 Didn't look like <i>you</i> attacked anyone.
6192354999952152 Who knows. If we attack each other today, might as well grow wings tomorrow.
6192354999952156 I don't like how pale you are. Let me dress your wound.
6192354999952157 Still, I'd like to dress your wound... if I had a bandage.
6192355001231851 Thanks.
6192354999952155 You're a true hero. Not because you defended me, but because you don't fear the truth. You can be trusted. 
6192354999952161 Yeah. You'll live.
6192354999952162 Saved their strength for me.
6192354999952160 I'm all right. They only hit me once or twice…
6192355000943163 Do lie down. I'll get something for you and come back.
6192355000943167 Thanks. That's useful to know.
6192355000943162 That's all right, I'll live. Although, you know... workers sometimes carry bandages and tourniquets around. Lots of injuries at the cannery. Talk to people, perhaps you can trade for some.
6192355000943165 Wait some more.
6192355000943166 Here, let me fix that elbow. Hold still...
6192355000943168 Nothing for now. I'll come back if I get a bandage.
6192355000943164 So you're back, huh?
6192354999964354 Kingfisher
6192354999948938 Who is he?
6192354999948941 Just wait until someone gets you, too.
6192354999948937 Whatcha lookin' at? Get lost. We got him first.
6192354999948940 …And what has he done?
6192354999948942 Have you lost your mind? He has nothing to do with this.
6192354999948943 Take a good look at me. <i>I</i> am 伊西多's son.
6192354999948939 Don'tcha see? 布拉克 the Turncoat! 伊西多's son himself!
6192354999948945 Pull it together, will you? Breathe. You're gonna pull a muscle—wouldn't be able to deliver justice, then…
6192354999948949 I am 阿泰米 布拉克, not this man. And I didn't kill my 父亲.
6192354999948944 The bastard put his own dad six feet under! So whatcha lookin' at? Get lost, or you're next!
6192354999948947 Done what? You idiots…
6192354999948948 …Right. Well, be careful not to take all this too far.
6192354999948946 Oh yes he does! The whole Town's saying he did it.
6192354999964353 Vigilante
6192355000130056 Swift
6192355000134953 Swift
6192355000145551 Swift
6192355000130069 Militia
6192354999965930 你是谁?
6192354999965933 What were you playing?
6192354999965929 Er… Sorry! I didn't mean to.
6192354999965932 What are you doing here?
6192354999965936 So you play piano.
6192354999965931 I just… dropped by to warm myself up. I'm from the cannery. Canning stuff.
6192354999965935 You played for the first time ever? That <i>is</i> weird.
6192354999965937 You're a savant, then. You should study music seriously. Leave for the Capital.
6192354999965934 No idea. I just came to it, raised the lid… and it kinda just… happened.\nSo I'm a musician, huh? Weird.
6192355000795258 Stump
6192354999965939 你是谁?
6192354999965942 How do you know this melody?
6192354999965938 Don't come closer. Or I'll scream.
6192354999965941 Who taught you this melody?
6192354999965940 I'm nearly screaming already.
6192354999965944 Nothing, really. I'm leaving.
6192354999965945 Don't piss me off, kid. Just tell me.
6192354999965943 This sweet melody is not your malady. 你想要什么？
6192354999965947 Play it one more time, will you?
6192354999965948 You sure are no sister of 卡佩拉's.
6192354999966451 Never coming back is a fate in store for all of us.
6192354999966452 You lying little punk. Your grimy fingers couldn't have created this melody.
6192354999965946 I wrote it myself. Just now. Will you flick off? Eff off? And never come back?\nMother told me not to say "fuck off" to people, not directly.
6192355000795257 Uta
6192355001452777 What kind of thing are you?
6192354999976211 How many dead do you think are down there?
6192354999976214 I have a name, you know.
6192354999976210 What do you want to hear, human?
6192354999976213 Is it possible to… relocate some of them somewhere else?
6192354999976223 Do the dead keep living underground? Or did 格蕾丝 dream that up?
6192355001452784 Are the dead truly uncomfortable down there? Or does it only seem that way to the living?
6192354999976212 More than I would like. Any other questions?
6192354999976216 I want to move the dead from the graveyard, but there's no place for them.
6192354999976217 Nothing. I don't like you.
6192354999976215 Two names. Maybe more. Two for certain. I do not care. 你想要什么？
6192355001452787 How are you going to arrange that?
6192354999976229 Arrange it, then.
6192354999976239 No, wait. I don't like the way you just licked your snout.
6192354999976218 It can be arranged. It would be my pleasure. Should I make it less crowded?
6192354999976225 How do I stop the screaming?
6192354999976226 The graveyard is crowded.
6192354999976224 She didn't.
6192354999976228 Can anything be done about it?
6192354999976227 Very much so.
6192354999976241 What exactly did you do?
6192354999976242 What, is that it?
6192354999976240 One moment… Another… Oh, so many of them. So many, indeed.\nThat's it. All done.
6192354999976244 I'm not dropping this. What did you do?
6192354999976247 I'll check.
6192354999976249 …Did you gobble them up, or something?
6192354999976243 I solved your problem. Got what you came for? You did.
6192354999976246 I didn't understand any of that.
6192354999976248 I understand.
6192354999976245 Whoever laid right of me, better to not think of them. But those to the left, they are fine now. Do you understand me, human? Go, human.
6192355001452779 Like hell I will.
6192355001452780 Your domain? Curious. Tell me, are there many dead people underground?
6192355001452778 Not the kind from your league. My own kind of thing. It's you who barged into my domain, not the other way around, so show some respect and kiss the hem.
6192355001452782 I need the dead to stop smothering one another underground.
6192355001452783 I think I'd prefer the latter. I don't like your tone. Or the smell. Rotting meat…
6192355001452781 Tell me what you want, human, or begone.
6192355001452786 How do I stop their screaming?
6192355001452785 You'll know when you're dead.
6192355001452789 Cremation would destroy them. You… maybe not. Go ahead, work your magic.
6192355001452790 Do it. For 格蕾丝's safety.
6192355001452791 Forget it. I can sense that your plans are vile.
6192355001452788 Safe and sound. So? I'm not a 城镇大厅 clerk, awaiting your orders…
6192355000437886 Does the plague really come from the earth?
6192355000437902 What kind of creature are you?
6192355000437905 Why are you torturing this woman?
6192355000437885 What do you want to hear, human?
6192355000437901 Not necessarily.
6192355000437909 If I kill as many as the sand pest? Yes.
6192355000437900 Everything comes from the earth. You came from it, as well, and will return in time. Is coming from the earth so great a crime that one must burn for it?
6192355000437904 Are you the voice of the earth?
6192355000437910 Teach me, then.
6192355000437903 I am not a creature. You do not know how to ask the right questions.
6192355000437908 You told 卡特琳娜 the plague and the earth are one and the same. How so?
6192355000437906 This woman tortures herself. She calls for me, I arrive. She questions, I answer. Our business is not yours.
6192355000437912 But sand pest is death itself.
6192355000437913 I don't.
6192355000437911 Here, the earth is still alive. Truly alive. You should know better than most—if you remember your pitiful childhood, of course.\nAll living things resist death. Do you understand?
6192355000437916 Not all of us.
6192355000437919 Thanks.
6192355000437920 Mice don't care about these matters.
6192355000437915 Time after time, I'm amazed by humans—the naivety, the conceit. You consider yourselves the crown of creation. That alone puts you above help.\nAny mouse understands its place better than your sorry species.
6192355000437918 Speaking of this woman, leave her alone. I'm asking nicely for now.
6192355000437921 How do I kill the plague? Tell me, if you know so much of the earth.
6192355000437926 We're stronger than you think.
6192355000437917 Only a handful of you think differently—like this unusually sensitive woman. But even they are not prepared to confront that which they seek. The truth snaps them in half like matchsticks. All in all, you are a weak lot.
6192355000437923 Who is "we"?
6192355000437922 How does one kill the self in oneself? Answer me this little question, human.\nYou still haven't found any answers to his riddle, other than mundane suicide. Carry on with that. We will help.
6192355000437925 No questions left.
6192355000437927 I've got some, but I don't care for your answers.
6192355000437928 I feel that all your words are lies. Or truths twisted beyond repair.
6192355000437924 So dumb… How can one be so dumb? So dumb, worthless, and narrow-minded? I hope you don't have any other questions.
6192355000437890 Rat.
6192355000437892 …What kind of creature <i>are</i> you?
6192355001514110 I know you. You aren't just any rat. You're a theatrical rat.
6192355000437889 Human.
6192355000437894 What are you, then?
6192355001514111 But…you were different before. You stood on your own legs. I even thought you might just be a kid in a mask, or a little person.
6192355000437895 Someone pinch me.
6192355000437893 I'm not.
6192355000437897 Happiness, I guess… Same as everyone.
6192355000437898 Truth.
6192355000437899 I'm just seeking you.
6192355000437896 A thing of shadow. A thing of the depths. A thing of Earth, flesh of her warm flesh. I know the answers. You don't even know the questions. What seek you within me?
6192355001514113 Huh… then, what are you?
6192355001514114 So many rats running around these days…
6192355001514112 That was a different creature. Not me.
6192355000467251 老鼠先知
6192354999976660 Not a person. A corpse.
6192354999976674 Like anyone's asking you.
6192354999976659 I refuse to burn corpses in the Factory's furnaces. 'Tis not God's way. A hock? Sure. A sausage? Be my guest. Leather to dry? I'm all for it.\nBut a person…
6192354999976664 Master of furnaces?
6192354999976665 Sabotage, then?
6192354999976663 Mr. Big-City Dandy wants us to burn corpses in the furnaces. He can burn or boil 'em back where he's from, but here, we don't burn our dead. I'm the master of furnaces, and that's what I'm telling you.
6192354999976667 So you refuse to burn corpses?
6192354999976670 No. I'm always on my own.
6192354999976671 With <i>my</i> people. I'm one of those steppe beasts, in case you wondered.
6192355001601451 It's the other way round. The steppe people despise cremation.
6192354999976666 Sabotage it is. We're not steppe beasts. We're civilized folk here. We have respect for the dead.\nYou see it our way, don't you? You're with us, with the people?
6192354999976669 You will burn the dead. If you won't, you'll die because of it.
6192354999976680 Whatever you say.
6192354999976668 That's what I'm telling you.
6192354999976673 Meaning you'll burn the dead. End of discussion.
6192354999976676 It's bad to leave the dead lying around. Corpses spread the plague, see? It spreads through the earth too. Flies carry it, for example.
6192354999976672 Huh. Meaning?
6192354999976678 …No. I really don't think it's all good.
6192354999976679 Not for us to decide.
6192354999976677 We have a graveyard. Dumping them into pits. Saw that, didn't you? Means city suit gave the order. Means it's all good.
6192355000474951 Clock Puncher
6192354999977652 What are you doing here?
6192354999977658 What did you find?
6192354999977651 Ugh, the little rat is crying. Will you help me carry it? Just remember it's mine. I found it.
6192354999977657 What, like rats?
6192354999977659 Show me your hands, hunter.
6192354999977656 Hunting.
6192354999977661 So, we're baby hunting. And how goes the hunt?
6192354999977666 What "sandbox"?
6192354999977660 An order came from the Sandbox. Anyone who saves a baby from a plague house gets their sins absolved. Easy, right?\nIf only you saw how many bastards were brought. But I have a witness now! Perfect! Can you help me carry it?
6192354999977663 I see you're no fan of babies.
6192354999977665 Won't you be a mother someday? Keep practicing.
6192354999977662 I don't want to touch it, you see. First of all, it's crying. Second, it stinks. But the crying's enough. I hate noise, I just hate it. Especially this kind of noise.
6192354999977668 Are you considering adoption?
6192354999977667 Are you from another planet? The 城镇大厅.
6192354999977670 You're shaking like a vampire around garlic! It won't bite you.
6192354999977671 Fine, I'll carry it. Just stay out of my way. You don't deserve absolution.
6192354999977669 Are you mad? Look, I adore children, just not so much <i>touching</i> them. I thought I could bear it, but… ugh.\nSo, will you help me carry it or not?
6192354999977674 I told you: I'll carry the baby. You go home. And don't you ever do this again.
6192354999977675 Fine. You deal with the little beast.
6192355001147256 Well… Fair enough. I'll still carry the baby, but I'll let the people in the 城镇大厅 know you were the one who found it.
6192354999977673 This is <i>utterly</i> unfair! I walked into a plague house! I showed courage! This is what they promised to reward, not <i>touching</i> them!
6192354999977740 And what are you doing here, blackbird?
6192354999977741 You're not the type to just give up.
6192354999977742 So you've finally acquired a taste for newborns?
6192354999977739 You've heard that bitch, surely? She's saying the child's no orphan, that it's hers! Oh <i>please,</i> it's ridiculous!
6192354999977744 Yeah, yeah, whatever. You're not taking them to the 城镇大厅, are you?
6192354999977747 Okay, stop yelling! Give us a break.
6192354999977743 Why are you mad at me? I'm no shabnak. I'm a poor performer trying to help. And yet you snarl at me the way a bear would a hunter!\nWhat if I have my own history with children, hm? A debt I must pay?
6192354999977746 I'm no ripper! I'm a physician.
6192354999977748 Where are you taking them? Answer me, you ghoul! To 老瓦? The herbalists? Tell me before I tear off your head!
6192355001647070 Where are you taking them? Answer me, you ghoul!
6192354999977745 I'm taking them somewhere safe. You think this is better?\nYou're not my confessor! You have blood on your hands, ripper. You shouldn't be around kids!
6192354999977750 "Good people," you say?
6192354999982651 This is madness…
6192354999977749 To good people! They make drugs out of them in the Sandbox, I think. No one knows what happens to them next, though.
6192354999982653 You know I'll figure it out anyway.
6192354999982654 Well, I won't try to beat it out of you. What if you start singing?
6192354999982652 Good, kind people. I've said all I can, and won't tell you anything else.
6192354999982673 Yeah, that's a… well-known fact.
6192354999982674 Exactly, she's a steppe woman, so I trust her more than you. So be quiet and let me talk to her.
6192355001149057 All right, I can see you desperately need redemption. Take the baby. Go on, save your soul.
6192355001149058 Wait. Give me a moment to think.
6192354999982672 Look at her face, she's a steppe woman! Do you know what they do to their babies? They turn them into soap! Everyone knows it!
6192354999982680 Okay, okay. Take it to these "good people" of yours. Try not to drop it.
6192354999982682 Stop arguing. I'll take the baby to the 城镇大厅 myself.
6192355001152657 Slow down!
6192354999982679 Well? Are you convinced now?
6192355000002452 Well, what do I have to do with it?
6192355000002453 I'm surprised it only happened yesterday.
6192355000002451 Listen, 布拉克. I'm in trouble. I was cursed yesterday.
6192355000002457 Undo what?
6192355000002458 Butchers don't curse anyone.
6192355000002459 I'm not a "ripper."
6192355000002456 This is the doing of your steppe butchers. Your rippers. You're a ripper. So you must know how to undo it.
6192355000002463 So is it the dead or dying?
6192355000002464 "Here" where?
6192355000002462 There's a man around town who can divine the future by reading entrails. A steppe haruspex. He dissects the dead… or dying… and tells the future.\nThey say he's always right. Got a ton of clients. And… well, here we are.
6192355000002466 And the living in question would be you, yes?
6192355000002469 Get lost.
6192355000002465 Why the fuck should you care? There's no salvation from the sand pest! They're all walking corpses, anyway.\nThis way, at least, they serve the living.
6192355000002468 Ah… I know this curse. It happened to me when I was a kid, too.
6192355000002470 I think you ought to share this with the 换生灵 girl. Sounds like her area of expertise.
6192355000002485 But what did you want to know?
6192355000002467 So I called upon his services. There was this… thing… that I really, very much needed to know.\nAnd now I've got this… heart. I've tried to throw it away, drown it in the Gullet <i>and</i> the Guzzle, bury it…\nBut it always comes back! I keep finding it in my bag, or in my bed, or in my pocket. I just thrust my hand there, and, and…
6192355000002472 Will you?
6192355000002473 Piss off.
6192355000002471 布拉克, it only happened because that… cutter, I mean, your colleague, wasn't a <i>true</i> haruspex. He didn't actually know those Lines of yours. Or so I am told!\nBut you do! Help me, 布拉克, please! I promise I'll be good from now on!
6192355000002477 Fine. Shut up. This heart of yours can't be thrown away. Only traded. Do you have it on you?
6192355000002480 I have no idea how to deal with this.
6192355000002481 Good, huh? Yeah, you're 换生灵 material.
6192355000002476 I am good, 布拉克! I had no idea he'd kill someone! Please! I'm basically on my knees here!
6192355000002479 Hold it in your hand tightly. Close your eyes. What do you see?
6192355000002478 Yes.
6192355000002483 Fine. If I find a spindle, I'll trade it to you.
6192355000002484 Here you go. And never do that again.
6192355000002482 I see… my beautiful face… no, wait. I see a spindle of sorts.
6192355000002487 Ah, well, that I can tell you for free: outlook not so good.
6192355000002488 You? Oh, you will. Everyone else may drop dead, but the likes of you always weasel their way through.
6192355000002486 Whether I'll survive.
6192355000734073 I'm not touching you.
6192355000734074 Quiet now… I'm a doctor.
6192355000904480 What is it with you artists always being so difficult? First Peter, now you…
6192355000734072 你想要什么？ Don't touch me! Stay away!
6192355000904482 They are.
6192355000904483 I'm not going to touch you! Stop yelling.
6192355000904486 My hands are covered in blood, so quit fooling around, little lady.
6192355000904481 Are your hands clean?
6192355000904485 So what?
6192355000904490 I am wearing gloves.
6192355000904484 You've touched the doorknob!
6192355000904488 I'm joking.
6192355000904489 I'm speaking figuratively.
6192355000904487 What? Blood? What do you mean, covered in blood? Just stay away…
6192355000904492 Calm down, please.
6192355000904493 I'm a doctor. Microbes run from me like the devil from a holy flame.
6192355000904494 Are you drunk, too?
6192355000904491 Microbes are transmitted with touch. They stay on the skin. Evil is transmitted with touch too, and it stays on the skin. <i>Fate</i> is transmitted with touch. \nAll this dirt changes you, killing you slowly… This is so repulsive!
6192355000904496 You're a circus artist, all right.
6192355000904497 You'll have to trust me if you want to survive this.
6192355000904495 I don't want to even think about it! Everyone is prattling about that toxic soot from the Factory! It's out there, behind the windows, everywhere… \nAll this dirt and grime… It's a punishment, that's what it is! It's all about those damned children!
6192355000904499 Look me in the eyes and listen to me. I'm going to give you medicine to protect you from microbes. Do you understand me?
6192355000904500 I'm a doctor, making my rounds. Do as I tell you. There is an epidemic in town.
6192355000904498 What?
6192355000904502 Not the plague. Something far worse.
6192355000904503 What kind of crime could condemn an entire town along with you?
6192355000904504 You're too full of yourself.
6192355000904501 An epidemic… Oh God. An epidemic. What? Plague? All my fault, my punishment…
6192355000904506 A real one. Trust me.
6192355000904507 I can't avoid touching you. Don't fret. Drink this.
6192355000904508 Just stay indoors. Your nerves won't survive a trip outside, circus girl.
6192355000904505 Are you a real medic? You really can help me? So I wouldn't… Just don't touch me!
6192355000770356 I thought you hated being touched.
6192355001427251 Like a child? Don't you hate children?
6192355000770355 I just want someone to pick me up and hold me.
6192355000770358 
6192355000770357 
6192355000770360 
6192355000770359 
6192355001427253 Should I tuck you in, too?
6192355001427252 I'm only joking. I'd rather like some candy, though…
6192355001427255 You like children, you say…
6192355001439848 You? Like children? They frighten you nearly to tears!
6192355001427254 Absurd! We never kidnapped anyone. They tagged along of their own accord.\nNo, rather… I'm not from no Caravan. Never was such a thing, sawbones. It's a myth. I just like children. I'm kind and tender like that.
6192355001427259 Y'know, children <i>are</i> rather ruthless creatures. Cruel, too. I'm starting to doubt my decisions.
6192355001427261 If nothing else, you can act. That was a masterful depiction of a child.
6192355001427258 …And sing me a lullaby.
6192355001427264 Always thought of my conscience as a presence rather than a void, myself.
6192355001427265 A drunken mind speaks a sober heart, indeed.
6192355001427266 Yes, sweet pea. Come on, let me hold you.
6192355001427263 Conscience is a hell of a thing. Like the gap between trapeze bars, it doesn't forgive.\nSorry, circus joke. You wouldn't get it.
6192355001439847 Wait, you're from the Caravan. The Caravan! The wandering, children-kidnapping circus!
6192355001439846 Me, hate? I adore children. Even professionally, sawbones! I'm a circus performer. I've handled more children than a midwife.
6192355001152653 Leave fate out of this.
6192355001180769 Perhaps it is fate. Our paths must have crossed for a reason… for the benefit of that kid.
6192355001180773 She needed that baby more. If you truly want to do good, find another opportunity. They're plentiful.
6192355001152652 No one ever believes me… I could turn myself inside out, and still, no one ever would! \nI genuinely wanted to do good… Then she came along, and then you! Am I cursed, truly? Fate… It must be fate…
6192355001180771 How do you know?
6192355001180772 What do you mean, "was"? Are you still trying to accuse that woman? That's slander!
6192355001180770 It was a girl…
6192355001448752 I'm not his harbinger. Actually, I'm kind of the opposite.
6192355001451866 你是谁, anyway?
6192355001555752 I'm still curious... 你是谁, in truth?
6192355001448751 This is my final hour. Death stands at my door.
6192355001509664 Yeah, sure.
6192355001535776 And I'm a local priest. I'm here for your confession.
6192355001509663 Me? A local milkwoman.
6192355001535772 What was the purpose of your life?
6192355001535773 Is that it? You're giving up?
6192355001535771 I dreamt of Earth today… I walked barefoot across a cemetery, past bones in spring snowmelt. 为什么？ What was the purpose of my life?
6192355001535775 You look unhealthy…
6192355001535777 In the old days, they believed circus performers go to hell. Remember?
6192355001535774 Fine, I'm an artist! A circus performer! An equilibrist. Happy now?
6192355001535779 Stop saying nonsense.
6192355001535780 Thought so.
6192355001535778 I'm from the Caravan. I was with the Caravan!
6192355001535782 I've heard of the Caravan. You made the papers…
6192355001535783 Come on, don't slander yourself. You're no equilibrist.
6192355001535781 We kidnapped children. Lured them in, turned them into circus freaks. Our maestro even sold some—to anyone who could afford them.\nI suspended myself from the trapeze, enthralling them with my disciplined form, luring them backstage after the performance.
6192355001535786 So you hide away in our backwater place, then?
6192355001535785 You're not so important that a whole town would be destroyed over you.
6192355001535784 This plague came after me. It's my punishment. I can't run, can't hide…
6192355001535788 Is that why you hate dirt?
6192355001535789 Did you harm a lot of kids?
6192355001535787 Yes.
6192355001535791 Makes sense. Circus performer…
6192355001535792 Well… You'll have to endure hell on your own.
6192355001535790 Quite a lot, but I'm not good at counting. I can't even read.
6192355001535794 No one does.
6192355001535795 But you'll have to.
6192355001535796 Then live. Perhaps you'll even make up for what you'd done…
6192355001535793 I don't want to die…
6192355000794358 安娜 Angel
6192355001258352 安娜 Angel
6192355000021086 But we need to fight. That's what makes life meaningful—whatever's left of it.
6192355000021087 You have a fever. You're delirious.
6192355000021088 …So what does that mean for me?
6192355000021085 If it's the same sickness, all measures are pointless. Wishful thinking; delusional actions. For it's clear what we're dealing with. Fire from heaven. The Great Flood. No one shall be spared, save for the ten righteous men.
6192355000021090 Yeah, that much is clear.
6192355000021091 It is a curious thought, true. I'll consider it.
6192355000021089 Forget the plague. You can't affect it. Think of yourself, not of the disease. Search your soul. Are you a righteous man, or are you one of the cattle for the slaughter? Whom will it kill, and whom will it spare? And 为什么？ \nThis is the curious question which must be answered. By me, doctor, not you.
6192355000415081 No, Ersher was my older brother. He died young. I'm 阿泰米.
6192355000415083 Does it matter?
6192355000421951 Those angry women in your yard… Have you seen them?
6192355000415080 伊西多's son. 阿泰米, is that right? Or is it Ersher?
6192355000415085 I thought your house had troubles.
6192355000415086 That street rat, 克拉拉, said you were in need of help.
6192355000415087 I don't have any requests. Maybe you have something to ask of me?
6192355000415084 Have you come to present yourself to the Mistress? It's taken long enough. I don't believe this is a courtesy visit. That means you have a request.\nSpeak.
6192355000415089 What's funny?
6192355000415090 So you're all right?
6192355000419689 卡特琳娜, are you sick?
6192355000415088 Ha! Now this is funny.
6192355000415092 You care for him so much… Though, it makes sense.
6192355000415093 I'll speak to him. Is he at the 城镇大厅?
6192355000415096 Perhaps, if I have the time.
6192355001224631 I've seen him already. And I've done all I could.
6192355000415091 I'm fine. Healthy and strong enough.\nBut my husband could benefit from your help. He requires your counsel, but is too proud to ask. 亚历山大 would rather bear all on his shoulders than distract you from your work. Could you speak to him?
6192355000415095 Really? That's strange.
6192355000415097 Very well.
6192355000415098 I'm glad I paid you a visit, 卡特琳娜. I'm starting to understand this house.
6192355000415094 Yes, at the 城镇大厅… Or maybe in his half of the house… I'm not certain. I haven't seen him in a while. Yes, quite a while… Almost a day.
6192355000419691 May I examine you, just in case?
6192355000419692 I'll be going, then.
6192355000419690 I have a weak heart, but that's nothing.
6192355000421953 Yes, I am.
6192355000421954 I'm not here for medical reasons.
6192355000421955 …You're a strong person.
6192355000421952 If not for the plague, the entire Town would crowd my yard. They all despise me, you know. Little by little, they encroach on all I hold dear.\nNo matter. You're a doctor, aren't you?
6192355000437853 I don't. Tell me.
6192355000437854 I can see that you're suffering.
6192355000437852 Do you know, 布拉克, where a Mistress' power comes from? The prophetic dreams, her influence over others, keeping the Town in balance…
6192355000437856 为什么？
6192355000437857 A glimmer of hope? From what?
6192355000437855 I am suffering—that is true. From pain. From sleepless nights. From impotence.\nRecently, I felt a glimmer of hope that my suffering was at an end. But I was mistaken. There is no hope.
6192355000437859 There are other powers out there.
6192355000437860 The earth is just soil. Nothing more.
6192355000437861 We're all bound to Earth.
6192355000437858 The power of a Mistress stems from the earth, and only from the earth, no matter what 妮娜 may have said. \nThe only true power is in the earth. It feeds us all. We grow as grass in the field, and breathe in its spirit.
6192355000437863 I don't have an ear for music either.
6192355000437864 All gifts are like that. Surgery, too—each body has its own feeling.
6192355000437862 All these years, I couldn't find the key. I was deaf and weak.\nIt's like musical talent—without it, one can hear, but cannot play. One without the gift cannot take up a melody started by another.
6192355000437866 Are you all right?
6192355000437867 You're raving. You need rest.
6192355000437868 The earth and rats are different beings. Don't confuse one for the other.
6192355000437865 But recently, the earth started to respond. The tiny people living underground. Mice and rats… and worms, 虫人too, but mice are more reliable. Rats, they're just like us. Their intelligence equals ours.
6192355000437870 Calm down. I believe you.
6192355000437871 The Kin say that in these cases the earth makes shabnaks.
6192355000437869 And how do you know that? What do you even know about these matters? When the earth must speak to people, it will take any form it wants!
6192355000437873 What does it tell you?
6192355000437874 Could it be your inner voice?
6192355000437872 Earth has no mouth, no ears. I see why my past attempts were fruitless.\nBut it took pity on me. It speaks through its herald—to me. He comes to me. Tells me truths. Truths a Mistress must know. All as it should be.
6192355000437876 Does it talk to you about your fears?
6192355000437879 Does it ask questions? It's important that you tell me.
6192355000437875 No.
6192355000437878 It might be your inner voice, 卡特琳娜.
6192355000437880 It is the voice of your fear.
6192355000437881 But the disease appeared only recently. The earth has been here forever.
6192355000437877 He says the sand pest and the earth are one and the same. That means there is no salvation.\nWe are bound to the earth. We walk it, we breathe it in, we eat its fruits, we cannot escape it. Our bond is inseverable. He's right. All signs confirm it.
6192355000437883 You need to get some sleep. Sound sleep will help.
6192355000437884 There's no one in this room but us.
6192355000437882 Ah, I don't know. I don't know anything.\nHere he comes again. He wants to speak to me, but I don't want to! I'm scared, 阿泰米. When I heard his voice, I began to believe in my power.\nBut now I see this power is useless.
6192355000771960 I'm sorry for your loss.
6192355001415569 Is that so?
6192355001415570 Was he ever? I mean, it's just a title…
6192355000771959 My husband is no longer governor…
6192355001415572 Didn't take you long to label everyone traitors.
6192355001415574 He really is an honest man.
6192355001415571 He's a ruler now. <i>The</i> ruler. The Bull Enterprise is destroyed. The 奥吉姆斯基 are over. The 凯恩s… are no longer on this side of the river. Everyone's scattered, like children after a game ends…\nBut my husband alone would never abandon his duty. His town.
6192355001415576 The bones are your family, I guess?
6192355001415577 Surgeons do.
6192355001415575 The 奥吉姆斯基 were always the guts: hot, alive, feeding the Town. The 凯恩s were the nerves: spark and potential. People cling to the belly for warmth. They grasp at the nerves to reach beyond themselves. \nBut no one ever dares to touch the bones.
6192355001415579 Sounds uncanny.
6192355001415580 Your husband is a man of honesty and resolve. He'll make a good ruler.
6192355001415578 Yes. My husband is this town's spine. And now, with that horrible weight lifted from him… he will straighten.
6192355001415582 Yes. Your husband was a strong man.
6192355001415583 No. But it will be different.
6192355001415581 And our town is no longer a town. Without 亚历山大, it will run a few minutes more, like a headless chicken, then fall…
6192355001447052 What are you doing here?
6192355001449751 Then who was wailing?
6192355001447051 I can't seem to get a good look at you… Wait. Yes. I remember. You're 伊西多's son.\nBut I did not call for help.
6192355001447057 So they locked you in this house and nailed the door shut?
6192355001447058 What were they trying to find out?
6192355001447059 Trapping someone inside an infected building is practically murder.
6192355001447056 I simply came here to see. A Mistress should know her town, don't you agree?\nThen people came, who doubted that I am me and wanted to be sure. Suspecting that I'm not a real Mistress seems quite popular these days.
6192355001447061 Has this been going on long?
6192355001447062 Come, I'll escort you out of here.
6192355001447060 Do you know the ancient way to identify a witch? If she drowns, she's innocent. If she survives, she must be a witch—off to the stake with her.\nAnd our town's residents have taken to testing people with the plague. They call it "sandboxing." What charming folk.
6192355001447064 Come with me.
6192355001594830 This town wasn't this absurd before.
6192355001447063 Since the Middle Ages.
6192355001447067 Well, I've removed the boards. You're free to go.
6192355001447069 你是谁 waiting for?
6192355001447066 I'm not done here yet. Be on your way now. I'm waiting for someone and don't need you around for that conversation.
6192355001447071 This place is dangerous.
6192355001447072 What are you talking about?
6192355001447070 That's what they thought. Do you imagine that those boards can measure up to the prison I've languished in for years? Hmph.
6192355001447074 So you are a witch after all…
6192355001447075 The most horrible prisons are always internal.
6192355001447073 Do you imagine that those boards can measure up to the prison I've languished in for years? Hmph.\nGo, 布拉克. Cure the ones who need it. I can deal with this house without your help.
6192355001449753 You're alone in this house, 卡特琳娜.
6192355001594827 The sound was coming from this room.
6192355001449752 I don't know. Someone in a different room, maybe.
6192355001594829 Well, I've removed the boards. You're free to go.
6192355001594828 Not you.
6192355000463051 卡特琳娜·萨普洛娃
6192355001258459 卡特琳娜·萨普洛娃
6192354999982656 Is it your baby?
6192354999982657 And you, why are you here?
6192354999982660 "Yargachin"? Not me, I'm not one of your butchers.
6192354999982655 Yargachin, calm this witch down. She is up to no good.
6192354999982659 Are you guilty of something?
6192354999982664 Why haven't I heard of this?
6192354999982658 They signed an order. We are to go door to door and search for the helpless. Especially infants. Whoever brings a baby from a plague house to the 城镇大厅 will be pardoned.
6192354999982662 Fine. So what's going on here?
6192354999982663 And 你是谁?
6192354999982661 It is a sign of respect. No one is wiser than a yargachin, one who follows the Lines with his knife.
6192354999989560 This is foolish. He'll be released, but you'll get sick and die. How does that help anyone?
6192354999989555 You are a brave woman, basaghan.
6192354999982665 My husband killed a woman on the first day of the outbreak. She was no shabnak. Now he awaits execution in the town jail.\nI would redeem him, yargachin. A life for a life.
6192354999982671 It's not true, basaghan. Why are you lying? I can see it.
6192354999982669 It is mine, yargachin. My child.
6192354999982676 Take it. I trust <i>you</i> more.
6192354999982678 I think neither of you is entirely honest. I'd rather take the baby to the 城镇大厅 myself.
6192355001152656 I'm still thinking.
6192354999982675 So, what have you decided?
6192354999989552 That is true.
6192354999989553 That's not true.
6192354999989554 It is good that you don't give up hope.
6192354999989551 I know not, yargachin. Why would you? You're a respected man, your 父亲's son. You're guiltless. Why bother you?\nYou have your own affairs to manage. They say you are looking for a cure. They say, "He's up all night, he's getting close."
6192354999989557 It's up to me what I to do.
6192354999989559 She's just like you.
6192355001152651 She should not. But neither is it wise to let her take the baby. Go ahead, basaghan, take it to the 城镇大厅.
6192354999989556 The likes of you and me are few and far between. This work is dangerous. This disease is dangerous. People like this woman are dangerous. She should be killed, yargachin.
6192355001152655 Such were the lines. I believed her, not you. End of discussion.
6192355001180767 You can't know that.
6192355001180768 Well… Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith. It's better than just not doing anything at all.
6192355001152654 What have you done, yargachin… You've ruined a life. Did the baby survive this pest only to be destroyed by that hag? Baarhani, baarhani!
6192355000795268 Khetey
6192355000004095 Well, now I'll have to.
6192355000004096 What happened here?
6192355000004101 Why did they lock you up?
6192355000004094 Did you come to mark this house?
6192355001203865 I can tell it's not the plague. Your skin is normal.
6192355000004103 I'm sorry.
6192355001203866 Flu… I doubt I can help you out with that.
6192355000004097 When the cough started, they began avoiding me. And then they locked me here alone! Yes, I'm sick, but not with this terrible plague! It's just a cold! Flu, maybe… Go ahead and examine me!\nJust… no quarantine, please! And don't mark this house!
6192355000004100 You can go outside. No one will stop you.
6192355000004104 They must have their reasons.
6192355000004099 Don't you know? New order. Quarantine. Forbidden for people to go outside. Yet here we are… Our neighbors want to hide this from the authorities. They're afraid of the quarantine. Terrified, even.
6192355000683451 Commoner
6192354999991353 也很高兴见到你。你是奥吉姆斯基的女儿？
6192354999991354 你知道我的名字？
6192354999991352 你是阿泰米·布拉克。你好。
6192354999991356 你还没有掌握……这门洞察的艺术？
6192354999991357 你说的是千里眼，还是什么？
6192354999991355 我可以<i>看。</i> ——我还没有掌握这门艺术，但是……我确实看到了，有时候。这是我从我亲爱的母亲那里继承的天赋。
6192354999991359 好吧，我们是朋友了？
6192354999991358 是的。我的名字是维多利亚，但是朋友们都叫我卡佩拉.
6192354999991361 真的？你怎么能这么快弄清楚？ 
6192354999991360 是的。
6192354999991363 强悍的天赋，如果你说的是实话。
6192354999991362 我的意思是…这很难解释。有时候在一个人在说话之前就知道他会说什么。或者我想象一种情况，第二天它发生得完全如同我脑海中所想。\n有时我甚至知道我不在场的过去的事情，比如几年前哪个抽屉里放了文件。
6192354999991365 了解了。
6192354999991366 我挺喜欢这种天赋的，就个人而言。
6192354999991364 没有那么强大，就我而言。不像我妈妈。她可以想看就能看到，尽管即使就她而言，这个天赋也可能是变化无常的。\n我很少看到，而且我完全无法控制。
6192354999991368 …或者将你会看到鬼和独角兽。
6192354999991369 那还是失去它比较好。
6192354999991367 妈妈说会过去的。我要么按自己的意愿去看，要么完全失去它。
6192354999991371 令我惊讶。
6192354999991372 所以这很常见？一个怪人已经告诉我我会的-
6192354999991370 你过分的讽刺已经被注意到了。在这个城市，天赋并不罕见。从前有几个女人能看见。妈妈。妮娜·凯恩娜，卡特琳娜·萨普洛娃，也许。外乡人带着这样的怀疑来到这里，但他们总是很快感到惊讶。
6192354999991374 你们俩串通好的吧，还是怎么回事？
6192354999991373 ——将整个小镇用血淹没。
6192354999991376 当然不怕，我是一个外科医生。
6192354999991377 我当然怕，有谁不是呢？
6192354999991375 你看起来并不害怕血，对吗？ 
6192354999991379 你问我？我毫无头绪。
6192354999991380 胡说八道。你在胡思乱想。
6192354999991378 你知道我看到了什么吗？在你的脚下，坚硬的土壤就像春天的融化，每一步都会形成一个红色的印记。你会在你醒来时留下一滩凝结的血，阿泰米·布拉克。 \n我以为这一定是谋杀案，但你不是凶手。这都是什么意思？
6192354999991382 我什么都不需要。我感觉到你眼中的悲伤。你哭了吗？
6192354999991383 人们经常来找你作为大维拉德的中间人吗?
6192354999991384 你哥哥？我为什么要找他？ 
6192354999991381 你为什么来？你在找我哥哥吗？或者你想让我问我父亲什么？
6192354999991386 她把家族聚凝聚在一起，是吗？
6192354999991387 每个人都爱你的母亲。我当时只是个孩子，但我也记得她。
6192354999991388 你的哥哥为什么生你的气？
6192354999991385 哦……我们家正在分崩离析。父亲和哥哥天天吵架，吵架得越来越大声，越来越残忍。\ N 哥哥生我的气…母亲死后一切都出了问题。
6192354999991390 他们的确需要它。
6192354999991391 但是你的哥哥为什么让你悲伤？
6192354999991389 我六岁时她就死了。在她的葬礼那天，我把自己锁在棺材里，这样就没有人能把她从我身边带走了。\n 哪天晚上，哥哥解释说没有别的办法：死者必须被埋葬。他说：“这对他们来说是最好的。”然后我明白了。
6192354999991394 你需要一个医生。这一切听起来不健康。
6192354999991395 你得让死者离开，孩子。
6192354999991393 多少年过去了？几乎九年了。我在家中走动，如同她依然还在这时一样。我把最后一块馅饼留给她。看着窗外，我移到一边，这样让她也能看到。我甚至把她的床角折起来
6192354999991397 你确定她想要这样吗？
6192354999991396 对来说，她没有死。只要我把那么像，我们就一直在一起。
6192354999991400 好吧。让我们挚爱的亡者安静地离去。
6192355000588297 没错。失去了父亲任何事都比以前难许多...
6192354999991398 你说话很痛苦，因为你父亲的死。对不起……我真的是那个意思。
6192354999991402 我表示哀悼。
6192354999991403 我想他不爱任何人。
6192354999991401 对。父亲的对我的要求有求必应。他告诉我我是他唯一爱的人。那是因为我很像母亲。
6192354999991405 ...让继承权归你，对吗？
6192354999991406 你哥哥现在在哪？我想见他。
6192354999991404 哥哥违背父亲的意愿。你的金族人组成了父亲的大部分劳动力。但他…他对他们不好。\ n 哥哥和他争论，但父亲不喜欢权威被挑战。他说他会剥夺我哥哥的继承权。
6192354999991408 他对此为什么这么生气？
6192354999991407 我不知道。他似乎和每个人都做生意。什么都知道。\n 作为家族企业，他……嗯……和大草原人打交道。所以父亲经常生他的气。
6192354999991410 又一个支离破碎的家庭。你的哥哥...他在家吗？ 
6192355001653007 又一个支离破碎的家庭...
6192354999991409 错！母亲从不想这样，父亲尊重她的意愿。现在依然...
6192354999991412 我明白了。
6192355000588294 不要绝望……即使是一个破碎的家庭也可以重新缝合在一起。有时，格里夫是就是那根可以用来缝合的线。
6192355001653008 我知道，我们已经见过面了。
6192354999991411 我想他现在在破碎之心。在大地区。事实上，他经常去那个地方……自从母亲死后。
6192355000588296 他现在和你生活在一起吗？
6192355000588295 那也是哥哥说的... 
6192354999991443 我想问你一些事。
6192354999991444 什么？你做了更多的有关我噩梦吗？
6192354999991442 发生了什么吗？你看起来很焦虑。
6192354999991446 你和我父亲很熟吗？你们经常聊天吗？
6192354999991445 不，我告诉过你，这种事不常发生。一个月一次，也许，或者每隔几个月一次。
6192354999991448 他写了这张纸条……来，看一眼。为什么这些名字会列在一起？你的名字也在这。
6192354999991447 是的，当然。
6192354999991450 他写了这张纸条……来，看一眼。为什么这些名字会列在一起？你的名字也在这。
6192354999991449 继续。
6192354999991752 你为什么皱眉头？有什么不好的吗？
6192354999991753 你们不久都会死吗？
6192354999991754 你是他的家长吗？
6192354999991755 ...和钱无关，是吗？
6192354999991751 ...我不知道，但我很怀疑。
6192354999991757 我对你的话简直一头雾水。
6192354999991756 嗯，不。大约一年前，你父亲开始找我们陪他。我们都在一起，有时，或三三两两。这是自然发生的。\n他……教导我们，我猜，但没有什么特别的。我认为这更多的是传递一些……非常重要的东西。
6192354999991759 继续，请。我尽力。 
6192354999991760 我在这里长大。在你学会字母表之前我就知道这一切。
6192354999991758 你是个外乡人。这很难解释。我们孩子在城里有自己的城镇。一个单独的。我们自己管理它。\n别给我那种傲慢的表情！这不是什么游戏。你…反正你也不明白！
6192354999991762 是的，我想。
6192354999991761 好的。你想知道你父亲为什么和我们在一起吗？或者不想知道？
6192354999991764 "重建"? 你是说摧毁小镇？
6192354999991765 传教徒啊，从不知道他还搞这个。
6192354999991766 "实施" 小镇？你的意思是"掌管" 还是什么？
6192354999991763 你父亲是……精明的。”他可以看到在粗糙的土地、琐碎的谎言和严酷的事实下的真相，”可汗曾说过。可汗不太喜欢他，但即使是他从多面体出来跟他说话了……\n 他相信我们会改造这个城市。重建并实施。在未来。
6192354999991768 我是。好吧，至少我挺喜欢的。
6192354999991769 很不幸，我不是。
6192354999991767 不，小镇就像音乐。你必须演奏，边弹边写，同时注意和声。你是个音乐人吗？
6192354999991771 你相信神吗？
6192354999991772 一切迟早都会结束。战争也是如此。
6192354999991770 我不知道。也许它不需要如此激烈。尽管…我想得越多，听起来就越烦人。也许我们会遭遇灾难？有传言说，战争向东推进。它不会结束……也许会发生什么事？当然，愿上帝阻止这一切。
6192354999991774 好。我想我会密切留意你们的。
6192354999991775 哦，爸爸。”我不会完全消失，不，“狡猾的很……
6192354999991776 我猜那我就得保护你不受任何邪恶的伤害了。
6192354999991773 这就是他为我们做的准备。改变小镇。我现在可以看到了。\n 他教了我们每个人一些重要的东西。也许……也许他把自己的一部分给了我们。对。那一定是他干的。
6192354999991778 哇，你都不犹豫一下。
6192354999991779 我也不。
6192354999991780 你这个年龄的女孩通常会说，“哦，我相信会有<i>某种</i>更大的力量。”
6192354999991777 不，我不。你呢？
6192354999991861 为什么住在这里而不是河对岸的塔？
6192354999991862 我看你现在不想接待客人。
6192354999991860 这里永远欢迎客人。
6192354999991864 所以你们是这么称呼它的？
6192354999991865 为什么？
6192354999991863 孤儿之塔？ 不适合我，我讨厌它。 
6192354999991867 这座塔和这有关吗？
6192354999991866 这不是建立一个王国之道。\n 王国建立在爱和关心之上。对待人，对待你身处的地方要宽宏大量，这样王国才能凝聚。
6192354999991869 我知道。这是大草原对准则的教义。
6192354999991870 首先，菌丝体不是这么运作的。
6192354999991868 它把孩子和父母分开。破裂家庭。撕裂连接。\n 当关系破裂时，生活就不能兴旺发达。如果切开血管，腿还能好吗？当蘑菇从菌丝体中被撕裂时，它能茁壮成长吗？
6192354999991872 比如？
6192354999991873 呵。我挺喜欢它的。
6192354999991871 也许…我的意思是，那座塔是要把东西撕碎。凯恩家就是为了这个建造的。他们认为骨折对灵魂有好处。\n我不那么认为。那座塔是许多罪恶的根源。
6192354999991875 你的意思是他们<i>建议</i>的，对吧？他们不能在萨普洛夫附近下达命令。
6192354999991876 他们为什么不让成人进来？
6192354999991874 没有人知道那里发生了什么。我能听到捕鼠人的调子，他的振动在召唤，引诱，但我不知道他想要什么。\n 你知道，当然，收集婴儿的主动权来自多面体吗？他们不会让成年人进来？
6192354999991878 我明白了。
6192354999991879 可惜他们不太急切着想见到我。
6192354999991877 规矩不允许。一个想法只需要成形就能变成真的……这就是凯恩家族的作风。\n 维克多对可汗过于宽容，尤其是在邪恶的妮娜死后。毕竟，可汗是他心爱的儿子。凯恩的主要继承人，家庭的希望。
6192354999991881 听起来很古怪。
6192354999991882 这就是我们生活的小镇。
6192354999991880 他们只是不知道。\n看，这就是塔如何运作的。每个人都知道成年人是不被允许的。没有人质疑它，甚至没有人费心去谈论它。事情就是这样的，每个人都接受它。然后，当他们的孩子离开他们时，他们流下了眼泪。
6192355000465700 我会竭尽所能照顾你吗。
6192355000465701 穆克怎么了?
6192355000465702 你怎么知道的？
6192355000465699 你会保护我们所有人吗？你父亲名单上的人。我认为他们是最脆弱的……\n特别是穆克。我很担心她。
6192355000465704 也许。我不是这方面的专家。
6192355000465705 当然。
6192355000465708 告诉我更多有关穆克的事。
6192355000465703 我是我母亲的女儿。我知道一些事情……有时我会感到心潮澎湃。\n 你认为我能成为一个真正的女祭司吗？蝴蝶会从茧中出来吗？也许有一天？
6192355000465707 她知道一切？比如？
6192355000465709 似乎这里其他每个孩子都有某种天赋。
6192355000465710 大地就是泥土，没别的了。
6192355000465706 穆克有……预感。她几乎是一个野性的孩子，没有被恰当地抚养。\n 但是她能感觉到事物，从某个地方知道一切。也许大地告诉了她。也许那是她的天赋…理解它的语言。
6192355000465712 不知道，怎么个情况？
6192355000465713  她 <i>为什么</i>跟踪我？我很好奇。
6192355000465711 你知道她在跟踪你吗？她怎么知道你是伊西多的儿子？
6192355000465715 ...穆克的家庭生活在粗蔓区，是吗？l
6192355000465718 我知道。
6192355000465714 五年前，你的父亲伊西多·布拉克做出了一个严峻的决定。疫情受阻，但许多人死亡。
6192355000465717 她肯定很恨我。
6192355000465722 ...理解了。
6192355000465716 你现在理解了吗？
6192355000465720 有关...难道我们不是吗？
6192355000465721 她是个可爱的女孩。
6192355000465719 不，但她觉得你和此有关。\n她心地善良。她不会因为你父亲的行为而责备你。她不记得她的父母，因为事情发生时她很小。但他们的离开使她痛苦。
6192355000771958 你说话如此礼貌...仿佛我们形同陌路。
6192355001433298 不...我做错了许多。
6192355001433299 I can hear the White Mistress' voice.
6192355000771957 我真的非常感谢你所做的一切，阿泰米。你做得很好，引领着这个城市走向未来。不管怎样，我都会很乐意报答你的好意。
6192355001433297 Your words are cold… I think <i>you've</i> already grown up.
6192355001433300 You're already building it.
6192355001433301 你们会从哪开始？
6192355001433296 我知道你除了哀悼损失无能为力。但你保存了最重要的东西——巫毒。因为巫毒是我们——人民，孩子们。我们将成长，建设一个新城镇——更美好、更平衡。
6192355001433303 你们会从哪开始？
6192355001433302 Yes. You're right, 阿泰米.
6192355001433305 但是你不喜欢可汗.
6192355001433306 Don't you miss the Polyhedron even a little?
6192355001433307 You know, 维多利亚, you've started to take after your 父亲.
6192355001433304 I'll marry 卡斯帕. The 凯恩s and the 奥吉姆斯基 will unite.\nThe Polyhedron, the Bull Enterprise… those were all cruel machines geared to produce utopias. Factories that processed people into ideas. But we'll make a world where people's bones aren't crushed under lofty words.
6192355001433309 We'll see about that.
6192355001433312 Not true. I admire you.
6192355001433313 Yes, White Mistress.
6192355001433308 And you don't like me. Yet we'll be allies anyway.
6192355001433311 I guess… You always know the right words to say.
6192355001433317 I'm not so sure.
6192355001433310 No. It was a factory of fantasies. Beautiful, yes, but heartless. I know you didn't want to destroy it; perhaps you even regret it. But that trap suffocated children. You released them. That was a good deed, 阿泰米.
6192355001433315 Don't you miss the Polyhedron even a little?
6192355001433316 Nice speech.
6192355001433314 When mother's radiance comes to full strength within me, I will fold my wings around my children, teach them to build, protect them from harm.\nThe Polyhedron, the Bull Enterprise… those were all cruel machines geared to produce utopias. Factories that processed people into ideas. But we'll make a world where people's bones aren't crushed under lofty words.
6192355001141158 Well, it does limit you. I only came into my own after I left.
6192355001452351 It's the same everywhere.
6192355001452352 Say... did you by any chance call to me? I sensed this strange prickling. Like you needed me...
6192355001141157 I'll never leave this place, even if just to visit someone. Mother never t拉薇尔ed, either.\nDo you think that's awful? Sometimes I recall that the wider world is vastly different than our corner—and yet I know nothing of it.
6192355001452354 Tell me… Is there anything you want from me? I had this odd <i>prickling</i> in my heart…
6192355001452362 It's healthy to doubt.
6192355001452353 That's what I thought. But now I'm not so sure…
6192355001452356 It did feel like a pulse.
6192355001452357 I felt like someone was staring at my back.
6192355001452358 Like I got blackthorn stuck to my foot.
6192355001452359 Like intuition. "I am expected—I need to come." That's it.
6192355001452355 Yes! You have such a sensitive heart. It never lies to you. You can hear! You can truly hear!\nI mean—I didn't call you on purpose. I can feel the Town, and touch it. It sings. And you hear its song too. You understand, don't you? It's a pulse. You've sensed it… Tell me, what was it like?
6192355001452361 Die?
6192355001452363 Get sick?
6192355001452364 Lose her gift?
6192355001452360 Anyway… something horrible is about to happen. And I can't do anything myself, no one would listen… not yet. That's why I thought of you, I guess… You're the only one who can take this seriously.\nIt's about 格蕾丝. She's all worn out, coming apart at the seams. And no one sees it, not even 格蕾丝 herself. If no one helps her get a grip, I'm afraid she'll…
6192355001452366 Like I have a choice. Coming apart at the seams… sewing the un拉薇尔ed back together is my thing.
6192355001452367 If I have the time.
6192355001452368 I think I know what this is about. The cemetery is overcrowded. "The dead are coming."
6192355001452365 I'm not sure. I'm not that good a seer yet. But I know that if she comes un拉薇尔ed now, that would be it. No one would be able to piece her back together.\nCan you pay her a visit? Can you help?
6192355001251352 Who?
6192355001251353 What did you play?
6192355001251354 I didn't see anyone.
6192355001251351 Did you see who it was?
6192355001251356 So what?
6192355001251358 It's Liszt.
6192355001251355 It was Mother's favorite melody. Her favorite. I think she wrote it herself. No one else could have learned it. Because she only played it for me, and no one else. Ever. Not even for Brother.
6192355001251360 Who was it, then?
6192355001251361 Does it matter, though?
6192355001251359 That's the thing. It wasn't me.
6192355001251363 Mysterious.
6192355001251364 Someone must have overheard the melody. They're playing a trick on you.
6192355001251362 I hear this melody often. I walk down the street and it comes from a window, or from a backyard, an attic, a cellar… I chase the sound, trying to locate the source. \nI always find the piano, lid raised. Someone has been there. But there's no one. No matter how hard I call.
6192355001251366 为什么？
6192355001251367 Well, I've heard the music too. So if it honestly weren't you...
6192355001251365 It's driving me mad. I've walked the whole Town back and forth, I've worn three pairs of shoes to rags, do you understand? Three, I'm serious. \nI wander at night, hoping to hear her, hoping to find whoever plays her melody. Who could know Mother so well? I won't believe it was <i>her…</i>
6192355001251369 I guess.
6192355001251370 I don't believe in the immortal soul.
6192355001251368 Well, because it's cruel. Believing that the souls of the dead still walk among us… is cruel towards them, don't you think? They deserve better.
6192355001251372 It definitely is a person. One day, you'll catch them.
6192355001251373 If I ever hear this melody again, I'll try to figure it out.
6192355001251371 What if it really <i>was</i> her spirit? Would that mean there is no death after all? But that's not even the point…\nI need to know for sure. Any answer would be a gift. It was her music, after all… Our music. If it's just some person playing, some person who was close to Mother, how could they do such a thing to me?
6192355001251375 I don't know.
6192355001251376 Does it matter?
6192355001251374 为什么？ Who would do something like this?
6192355001251378 It was a person, after all.
6192355001251379 It wasn't a person.
6192355001251377 Why do you stare at me like that?
6192355001251381 Whoa! You <i>are</i> 大 维拉德's daughter after all. That steel in your voice! It was 克拉拉. The girl who—
6192355001251382 Just a random worker.
6192355001251383 Some little girl.
6192355001251380 …Who was it, then? I want to talk to them.
6192355001251385 The musician was possessed.
6192355001251386 A girl who played told me.
6192355001251387 The piano kept playing music even when no one was in the room.
6192355001251384 How did you know?
6192355001251389 I don't think you do.
6192355001251390 You tasked her with the same errand, right?
6192355001251388 —I know who 克拉拉 is.
6192355001251392 I'm sorry.
6192355001251393 I'm not sure it's that simple.
6192355001251391 In that case… it means there's nothing after death. I see.
6192355001251395 I've no idea. He didn't seem like the sharpest tool in the shed.
6192355001251396 It's odd. He didn't understand it, either. He was frightened.
6192355001251394 And the melody? How does he know it?
6192355001251398 She mostly made fun of me. Didn't learn much.
6192355001251399 She said she was also looking for the ghost who played piano.
6192355001251397 What does she know about Mother?
6192355001251401 You don't look relieved.
6192355001251402 I'm happy for you.
6192355001251403 I'm happy for your mother.
6192355001251404 Death brought no solace to her, then.
6192355001251400 So it <i>was</i> Mother. So she is still here. So there is still hope.
6192355001251406 Whatever you say…
6192355001251405 Impossible.
6192355001509368 Of course. I used to have a brother.
6192355001509369 Did 斯塔克 get to you, too? Drop it. I understood his deal already.
6192355001509370 You mean he was like a 父亲 to this whole town?
6192355001509371 斯塔克 is dead, if that's who you meant.
6192355001509367 伊西多 布拉克 was a 父亲 to more than just you. Do you realize this?
6192355001509373 <i>You</i> come to <i>me.</i> Not the other way around. The Lines lead you.
6192355001509374 父亲's will was that I take care of you. That's enough for me.
6192355001509375 I'm not trying to be.
6192355001509372 You walk 伊西多's path, and you're very good at it! You have extraordinary hands—light like wings. I will always be by your side, will always help you with anything.\nExcept for one thing. You're not our 父亲.
6192355001509377 <i>I</i> keep you in the past? How exactly? I don't ground anyone; I don't even make them bathe!
6192355001514124 So you're suggesting I abandon you all to the whims of fate?
6192355001526251 Maybe you'll lead them—one day. But right now, you're an adolescent girl, 维多利亚! How old are you, like fifteen?
6192355001509376 Children are warm creatures. They smell of milk; they listen eagerly to your every word. And… you tried. I can see that.\nBut your care keeps us stuck in the past. In childhood. They need someone to lead them into the future.
6192355001514118 Like I wanted to! It would be so much easier on my own…
6192355001514119 There's a <i>plague,</i> if you haven't noticed. Is there any place safer than a doctor's house?
6192355001514120 What are you getting at?
6192355001514117 Don't you? How many children are holed up in your house? How many did you promise to take in at some point? How many did you consider protecting?
6192355001514122 I <i>am</i> a doctor. No point in "ifs."
6192355001514123 Well… who knows. What are you getting at?
6192355001514121 So if you weren't a doctor, you wouldn't care about us?
6192355001525231 What else do you see? Tell me now, please, instead of barging into my head.
6192355001514134 It's all right. Useful, even.
6192355001514135 I accept your apology. But don't do it again.
6192355001658561 It's not like you summoned me. My Line brought me here.
6192355001514133 Scattered thoughts and anxieties pop into my head… because we're connected, you and I. \nI'm sorry you have to hear them sometimes… That's my mother awakening inside me. I can't help it. Because I see you.
6192355001514138 …They'll soon die and turn to soil?
6192355001514139 …Someone else is coming to the Town? Death, in an iron cart?
6192355001514140 …I'm not doing enough for them?
6192355001514137 Yeah. I've been having uncanny dreams lately too. I'm exhausted…
6192355001514136 I had a dream yesterday. All our children lay on the ground, and a white flower grew from each of their heads. You'd water them when they were sad, and sometimes picked leaves from them for your potions.\nAnd then a cart ran over them all, and its wheels ground them to dust.
6192355001525225 为什么？
6192355001525226 Indeed it isn't.
6192355001525224 You came because you sensed me thinking of you. Inadvertently, I touched you with my thoughts. And it isn't the first time…
6192355001525233 How so?
6192355001525234 You're seeing it wrong.
6192355001525232 I see that you and I have different paths. You are about to do something terrible—and destroy all the children.
6192355001525236 Death came to our town a week ago.
6192355001525237 You thought you were the only one? Mistress…
6192355001525235 Actually, you're right. Death is coming to our town in an iron cart. Precisely.\nSo you see these dreams, too?
6192355001525239 Go home, girl. And take the others with you. It's safe there.
6192355001525250 Wait. Let's not argue, or we'll make a mess… Can you explain this all to me, in more detail?
6192355001591951 That's not what you said about 格蕾丝. With her, you specifically asked for my help.
6192355001525238 Yes. They need help. Mine, not yours.
6192355001525241 "Taking them"? What do you mean?
6192355001525242 You're one of the children in my care. Go home.
6192355001591955 So… there's no need for me to hurry and help 格蕾丝? You'll manage that on your own? And cure the sick, too?
6192355001525240 I'm taking them from you. The ones you took care of. I'll do it now. And I'll do it better.
6192355001525249 You're in danger too! Irresponsible girl… You'll be the first to die!
6192355001526255 So you want to become a Mistress…
6192355001525248 You can't look after them as I do. They'll die if they remain your wards. Because you're still so far from understanding. You can't sense the Town as I do.\nI'm taking them from you.
6192355001526254 Strange… So have I.
6192355001526264 What do you mean, you'll linger in me? Like—intruding on my thoughts, even if you die?
6192355001526253 No. Even if I die, I'll still linger… in them. In you all. Even in you yourself. I have seen that, too.
6192355001526257 You're getting ahead of yourself.
6192355001526256 I am becoming one already. So looking after them is my duty.
6192355001526260 I can see that. Taking the children! Friends don't do that.
6192355001526261 I thought better of you, 维多利亚 奥吉姆斯卡娅. Your mother would never have done this. And leave my thoughts alone!
6192355001526262 You truly are your 父亲's daughter. Children always succeed their parents…
6192355001591965 I've had enough of this nonsense. Everyone who entrusted their lives to me remains under my protection. Including you.
6192355001526259 Still, we're too different, you and I. I will always be your ally. But we aren't friends. I'm sorry.
6192355001526266 I still hope that was just my intuition, that you just have an overly active imagination.
6192355001591966 I hope we never get a chance to find out.
6192355001526265 Perhaps.
6192355001591953 You might be right, but what can be done?
6192355001591954 I will. I'll guard them with my life.
6192355001591952 Yes… but that was different. That was about her alone. Now I'm speaking of all our children, the whole <i>tagloor.</i> I sense you won't be able to protect them.
6192355001591957 What did you mean, then?
6192355001591960 Rain at seven, fine at eleven.
6192355001591956 …There's no need to be like that. You know that's not what I meant.
6192355001591959 Speak to <i>what?</i> 维多利亚, there's an outbreak! To save anyone, I need to work, to make the cure—not argue abstract ideas.
6192355001591961 It doesn't ask who it should visit.
6192355001591958 When… when <i>the</i> trouble comes for them, let me be the one to shield them. Not you. All right? I'll speak to it myself.
6192355001591963 Believe what?
6192355001591962 Have you made it already, then? Or are you like that fancy big-city doctor, claiming that all we need for salvation is chemistry?\nHe's a nonbeliever. But you're a better man. You know the world is more complicated than that. So believe <i>me!</i>
6192355001467052 Why are <i>you</i> here? I thought you didn't like the Polyhedron.
6192355001505551 I came to see you. Will you stop me?
6192355001594757 The district below is infected. Anyone sick among you?
6192355001467051 Why are you here? I don't understand. They won't let you in, anyway. You know this, and yet you came.
6192355001594758 Don't talk about 可汗 like that. He's alive.
6192355001505553 I don't give a damn about your tower. I just need to make sure you're all right.
6192355001505556 为什么？
6192355001505552 The sick go to a hospital. You may curse it, but you'd still go there to care for them. That's what doctors do, isn't it?\nI'm here for my children. I'm the only protector they have left. 可汗 might have done it, too… but he's not with us. So I say this in his stead: you aren't needed here.
6192355001594762 Won't it topple over? There are a lot of children in the Town…
6192355001594763 Will you be happy in there?
6192355001505554 The Town's children are gathering here—the healthy ones, anyway. We'll be fine here. There's no sand pest inside. \nWe'll wait on the steps until tomorrow. Whoever shows any signs of it will descend. The rest will take shelter in the Polyhedron.
6192355001505558 Fine. Have it your way. Just tell them that I… care about them.
6192355001505560 You're cold, 维多利亚.
6192355001505557 Children love this tower, 阿泰米. They just <i>do.</i> So let them stay here until the end… It's close, isn't it?\nThey're so happy here… if only you could see. I'm watching them be happy. Go. Don't disturb us. You're not needed here.
6192355001594760 I'll cure him.
6192355001594761 He's still a child himself. Both of you are.
6192355001594759 Yes. For now. But he's sick. He must not get close to children. Not here.
6192355001594765 What are you doing, 维多利亚…?
6192355001594766 Is there no other shelter?
6192355001594764 The Polyhedron is all smoke and mirrors. A giant soap bubble. I hate it… \nBut my feelings matter very little now. The plague can't get inside—that's a fact. It will offer protection. You, on the other hand, have just crossed an infected district. So I won't let you near the children. They're my responsibility.
6192355001499052 No way in hell. First, there's nothing good about any of this. Second, I won't give up on you. I'll help you.
6192355001525184 That's why I came, 维多利亚… to apologize. To you all…
6192355001591967 If… if I had let you take them away from me back then, would it have turned out differently?
6192355001525223 Farewell.
6192355001499051 I thought I was a Mistress… That it was my destiny to defeat this plague… but it turned out differently.\nI guess this is goodbye, 阿泰米.
6192355001525164 I know.
6192355001525170 …Your subjects.
6192355001525163 They were all taken away from me… on a train car. Everyone under my wing. The future of the Town.
6192355001525166 I know.
6192355001525169 Thank you. I'll check up on him.
6192355001525173 You care about him a lot.
6192355001525165 Take care of 可汗. He's in the Nutshell.
6192355001525168 It's not over yet. I'll think of something.
6192355001525185 I'll get more of… that thing the panacea's made from. You'll all get better. I just need time.
6192355001525167 Is there anything else you can do? Anything at all?
6192355001525172 So you've become a Mistress after all.
6192355001525183 They'll return. Nothing is over, do you hear me? This is just the beginning!
6192355001525171 No. Not my subjects. My children. They would have remained my children even as they'd grown up…
6192355001525175 Do you love him?
6192355001525182 He'll live. I promise.
6192355001525174 Very much so.
6192355001525177 Does he love you?
6192355001525181 I see. Although… no, to be honest, I don't understand.
6192355001525176 No. Not yet.
6192355001525179 …For the good of the Town.
6192355001525180 Dynastic marriages…
6192355001525178 I don't know. And truly, I don't care. You wouldn't understand. But we must be together.
6192355001525187 I will. Don't worry. Take care of yourself for now. And hold on…
6192355001525188 I'm sorry I failed you.
6192355001525186 Please take care of my children… if any are still left in the Town, if any are still alive. Someone must be—I can tell! But my senses are clouded by pain… I can barely see.\nGod, it hurts so much… so much…
6192355001591969 Damn it… Damn it!
6192355001591970 It's all right. I can. I see a long and happy life ahead of you.
6192355001591968 I don't know. I can't see anything now…
6192354999991351 卡佩拉
6192355000261451 卡佩拉
6192355001258458 卡佩拉
6192354999996360 Why are you here?
6192354999996361 Was that you playing?
6192354999996359 What do you want, Ripper? Are you trying to catch the White Mistress, too? \nIt's futile, 布拉克. She won't help anyone anymore. Won't save anyone.
6192354999996363 So it wasn't her soul…
6192354999996364 …So there is no afterlife. Not even in this form.
6192354999996362 I'm running the same errand you are. Looking for Mother 维多利亚. And getting paid handsomely for it, by the way. Are you? I am.\nSo here I am, playing. Perhaps someone will respond. But it's futile. No one does. Well, you did, but what use do I have for a moron like you?
6192354999996366 …So there's no White Mistress anymore?
6192354999996367 That's what I thought.
6192354999996365 So it wasn't.
6192354999996369 …Is there an immortal soul?
6192354999996370 I guess I did.
6192354999996368 So there isn't. In any shape or form. Did you really hope for something different?
6192354999996372 I thought you'd know for sure.
6192354999996373 And they call you kind… a saint, even.
6192354999996371 Perhaps there is. But I doubt it.
6192354999996375 Fair enough.
6192354999996376 I'll relay this to 卡佩拉.
6192354999996377 Just… don't you dare tell 卡佩拉 that. Or I'll snap your neck.
6192354999996374 Perhaps I do. Do you really want to?\nYou don't. Live with hope, 布拉克. It's more comforting that way.
6192354999995490 换生灵
6192355000795256 克拉拉
6192355000004060 Your chemist provides services to people who don't want to bury their dead.
6192355000004061 What do you 凯恩s want?
6192355000004147 Not really. Just here to catch my breath.
6192355000004059 Is it urgent?
6192355000004064 He embalms dead bodies. Turns houses into tombs.
6192355000004071 He says you endorse his actions. Living people are sharing their homes with the dead now. Are you happy?
6192355000004063 My chemist? We don't have a chemist.
6192355000004066 No. Goodbye.
6192355000004067 It's just you all pursue such strange things.
6192355000004068 Then why does your chemist help spread the disease?
6192355000004065 Same as everyone. To curb the outbreak and get on with our lives. To turn this town into the best place on earth. \nAnything else I can help you with?
6192355000004070 Agreed. It would be nice to rein in your overly zealous chemist, for example.
6192355000004069 Your 父亲 has been arguing with my older brother about it for years. Now is not the time to follow their example. We have more urgent business.
6192355000004073 …
6192355000004074 Thank the gods… I almost believed it.
6192355000004075 Me too.
6192355000004072 …If I'd learned about this earlier, I would have torn his head off already.\nNow give me thirty-five seconds of silence, please. I need to think.
6192355000004077 Possibly.
6192355000004078 Most likely.
6192355000004079 I don't know. I'm 一个外科医生。
6192355000004076 The Cemetery is overcrowded… I see.看墓人 girl forbids mass graves, and stirs unrest… Yes. I've received these reports. People hide their dead to avoid having them burned… Corpses multiply in living rooms… Does the infection linger in dead bodies?
6192355000004081 You can tell a house where dead bodies are hidden by the sound.
6192355000666990 I suppose I should look around the pharmacy the embalmers operate from. They're bound to jump at an opportunity to work near their base.
6192355000004080 How will you go about the search?
6192355000666992 A hammer, maybe… I bet someone must be taking care of them, boarding the tomb off.
6192355000666994 Each house has a sound of its own. One that has dead people inside can't sound like a normal one.
6192355000666995 Don't mind that. I'll find the place and mark it with a cross for your people to find.
6192355000666991 How?
6192355001200395 What do you mean? Lots of them.
6192355001200399 My informant told me that this has been going for a whole day, maybe longer.
6192355001241470 I'd search the houses next to the drugstore.
6192355001200394 This activity needs to be immediately curtailed. Do you know which house they were planning to visit?
6192355001200397 Leverage? Do you really need it? No one would question a 凯恩's actions.
6192355001200398 Doesn't a white cross mean a house is condemned?
6192355001200396 I have a favor to ask of you, 布拉克. Find at least one house where the living harbor the dead. Find it and mark the door with… say, a white cross, as they did with the plague in the old days.\nIt will become my proof. Then I'll have leverage to deal with this matter.
6192355001200401 I do.
6192355001200400 Exactly. We're the 凯恩s. People only let us break the laws of nature because we obey the laws of justice. Do you understand?
6192355000004149 Your daughter is out of control. She's marking houses with crosses on a whim.
6192355000004150 Not really. Just here to catch my breath.
6192355000004148 Is it urgent?
6192355000005552 She doesn't believe you will.
6192355000005553 Good, that's all I wanted to hear.
6192355000005551 I'll put a stop to that.
6192355000005555 I'm not sure. She was talking to the house.
6192355000005556 Responsibility…?
6192355000005554 She's struggling with our family's tragedy. 玛利亚 took 西蒙's death very much to heart. She believes it put new responsibilities on her. How did she explain her actions?
6192355000005558 Not really.
6192355000005559 I do.
6192355000005567 People were scared of 妮娜, that much I remember.
6192355000005557 She believes that the time has come for her to replace her mother. \nI don't suppose you remember 妮娜 well, but she was the heart of this town. Its author. Its spirit. Its power. She could breathe life into inanimate objects. Literally. Do you know what I'm talking about?
6192355000005561 She said it has a lot of filler.
6192355000005562 She said houses are living beings.
6192355000005560 玛利亚 sees… meaningful dreams. We never ignore them. But she doesn't yet know how to interpret them. She takes valuable information and draws incorrect conclusions.\nDid she tell you that the Town itself is causing the outbreak?
6192355000005564 My job was to warn you. The rest is up to you.
6192355000005566 Don't be too harsh on her.
6192355000005563 And you most assuredly do not agree. You take it for the wild fantasies of an unbalanced girl. Yet I am positive there is a grain of truth to her thinking, and you will soon bear witness to that.\nBut let's set this aside. I will put a stop to her.
6192355000005569 Sorry.
6192355000005570 Oh, in no uncertain terms.
6192355000005568 I have no intention to debate my wife with you. Is that clear?
6192355000021058 What does that mean for me?
6192355000021059 The Theatre is a wise choice. Now is not the time for plays.
6192355000021060 An anatomy theatre, huh? You have a talent with puns.
6192355000021057 The hospital will be set up in the Theatre. Possible infected will be examined there every day. The disease will be studied, and we'll even try curing it. \nThey say there's no cure for the sand pest, but Doctor 丹考夫斯基 still has hope.
6192355000021062 I was planning to.
6192355000021063 I'm not sure if this is the right place to find that cure.
6192355000021064 In that cesspool of infection? You'll have one fewer doctor in a couple of days.
6192355000021061 It means that the Theatre is your place now. Your real home. Tend to the sick, and dissect the dead. \nWork night and day to find a cure for this accursed plague.
6192355000021106 Fair enough. My life just became very precious.
6192355000021107 Did he tell you that? Bullshit.
6192355000021108 I am my 父亲's son. 奥吉姆斯基 is no one to me.
6192355000021105 But you are 奥吉姆斯基's private doctor now, aren't you? I guess he'll object, then. Or even forbid you to risk your life.
6192355001415628 Drawing a plan for the future?
6192355001415629 There are no more nerves… The Earth is dead. It lost too much blood.
6192355001415627 …They were always driven upwards, and that's what became their downfall. Too straightforward an interpretation. We need to follow the magnetic lines—they are the nerves of the earth.\nWe'll make a massive glass podium in the center. Like a lens, you see? And inside it, a compass.
6192355001415633 So it's a sentient corpse, now? Better than… just a corpse, I guess.
6192355001415634 A curious way of looking at it.
6192355001415632 Blood is only food for the spirit. For as long as we stand on this ground, its gravity exists, driving us down. While we are driven, we live.
6192355001415636 You mean that… literally?
6192355001415637 You're right. What is essential is invisible to the eye. It's felt, in the bone.
6192355001415635 We've done too much looking and not enough listening. Yes, that's it! Sight is humanity's primary sense, so it impedes us. Too simple, crude.\nIn our new town across the river, we won't let ourselves rely on sight.
6192355001415639 Look, I'm just happy you're not going to gouge your eyes out.
6192355001415640 Excuse me, then.
6192355001415638 How primitive of you.
6192355001415642 Sorry. No looks. You're biased against sight, I got it.
6192355001415643 Hm… I guess I'll drop by.
6192355001415644 Good luck.
6192355001415641 We will not govern our new town. We need to find a way to avoid governing it… so it will govern us. Houses will write edicts. Streets will invent laws. Roofs, sentence criminals. \nDon't give me that look. But do come when our new town is complete. You'll be welcome.
6192355000845852 At least you tried.
6192355000845853 Why do you think it failed?
6192355000845851 It all failed. The isolation ward in the Cathedral, the hospital in the Theatre… Even the cemetery is an issue now.
6192355000845856 But at least we studied the disease.
6192355000845857 But at least people had hope.
6192355000845854 Was there a single person who left this hospital healthy?
6192355000845859 Yeah? What can they do? Send the Army?
6192355000845858 The Town is dying. And now this 审判官…\nThe Powers That Be know everything. They won't be lenient anymore.
6192355000845861 Cheer up. We've found the cure already. Victory is at hand.
6192355000845862 See? It could have been even worse.
6192355000845860 The Army… No, I don't suppose they would do that. What's the point? It would just be a waste of 士兵s.
6192355000850094 Are you the Judge?
6192355000858263 Where is Georgiy?
6192355000850093 Can I help you?
6192355000850096 Personal business.
6192355000858264 I am 伊西多 布拉克之子。 I'm here about our house.
6192355000850095 The Judge is in his workshop. What business brings you to him?
6192355000858262 How did it turn out, exactly?
6192355000858280 What is this thing you've built here? How does it stay upright?
6192355000858261 格里夫 comes in spades these days. Who could have known the Polyhedron will turn out this way?
6192355000858266 You seem troubled.
6192355000858267 You're in mourning too?
6192355000858265 The workshop is in the right wing of the mansion. We're in mourning today, but I think he'll want to meet you.
6192355000858269 I haven't.
6192355000858270 I have.
6192355000858268 Yes. 西蒙, our patriarch, died two days ago under mysterious circumstances. Haven't you heard?
6192355000858272 …How old was he?
6192355000858275 I heard he was a close friend of my 父亲, who also died two days ago. An odd coincidence, don't you think?
6192355000858271 Strange. The whole Town knows. People loved him. He was this village's creator, after all.
6192355000858274 Of course I have.
6192355000858273 Quite old. You're 布拉克's son, so you must've spent your youth here. Haven't you heard stories of 西蒙?
6192355000858277 I hope so too.
6192355000858278 I'll un拉薇尔 it myself.
6192355000858276 Odd indeed—if a coincidence at all. I hope 萨普洛夫's people can un拉薇尔 this case.
6192355000858282 I sense a but.
6192355000858281 From the Capital, we have summoned the 斯塔马丁 brothers—two architects. They've come forth with a bold project: a contraption that defies gravity. \nIn the Capital, they were ridiculed. We thought differently, and so we granted them this opportunity. As you can see, the Polyhedron soars.
6192355000858284 Are you afraid that the Tower will collapse?
6192355000858296 Why have you let them in?
6192355000858283 But the Polyhedron took away our children. The Tower fascinates them. Inside, they've built something like a sovereign country, with my own son in charge. No one has any idea how to make them leave.
6192355000858286 What's his name?
6192355000858300 So those children are running wild now, living by their own laws?
6192355000858285 No. It's just that the Tower… does something to them. They don't explain this to outsiders, but I think it materializes illusions. Some sort of optical effect. Vibrations too, of course…\n西蒙 was adamant that we do not hinder the children in any way. Claimed this was the entire reason for the construction. But… I want my son back.
6192355000858288 可汗. Wait… He was among the children my 父亲 taught.
6192355000995093 Your son spends all his time up there?
6192355000858287 卡斯帕. Kids call him 可汗. He is their leader. I suppose, as his 父亲, I should be proud.
6192355000858290 I see. I'd like to speak to 可汗, if you don't mind.
6192355000858293 Can you describe their teachings?
6192355000858289 Yes. He and your 父亲 spent a lot of time together last year. \n西蒙 and 伊西多 gathered some kind of coterie of children. Ones they had special hopes for. I didn't have enough time to grasp the things those two taught our children.
6192355000858292 I'm going to try anyway.
6192355000858299 Thank you. I'll go and see the Judge now.
6192355001188555 Yeah… I gathered as much.
6192355000858291 Well… They do come out from time to time. Less often than I'd like. \nAbandon any hope of entering the Polyhedron, though. They don't let adults in.
6192355000858295 Is your son in the Tower right now?
6192355000858294 I cannot. I'm sorry, but I just don't know. I trusted 西蒙 and your 父亲. They would not harm children.
6192355000858298 And it doesn't matter to you if they change people for the better or for worse, does it?
6192355000858297 My brothers, 西蒙 and Georgiy, insisted that we have to let children play. In a way, I agree with them. \nThis is why we 凯恩s create all these buildings, after all. To change people.
6192355000858302 And your son…
6192355000858301 Don't ask me how that happened. There was no sinister plan behind this. In a single day people have accepted this state of affairs. \nThis town does strange things to us. I think this experiment might be out of our control now. No surprise, given that 西蒙 is dead…
6192355001203884 I marked the door with a cross. Send your people, just don't be too hard on the locals.
6192355001193260 I've found one. It's near the Stillwater.
6192355001193259 Any luck?
6192355001203886 You're right, I am afraid.
6192355001203887 It's the thinkers and dreamers who can afford fear. I am a doer.
6192355001203885 Why would we harm them? Their only crime was being scared. What kind of monster punishes fear in times like these? Everyone is afraid, including you and me.
6192355001503580 Not for service, that's for sure.
6192355001503588 No one knows what the 凯恩s' creations are for. The Polyhedron, the Cathedral, those dilapidated stairs… Do you even know yourself?
6192355001503582 Tell me.
6192355001503579 Do you know what our Cathedral is for?
6192355001503591 Meaning…?
6192355001503592 Like trees produce wind?
6192355001503590 It produces time.
6192355001503594 I'm no physicist, but this is bullshit.
6192355001503595 All over the world? Or just in our town?
6192355001503596 Can this… production be stopped?
6192355001503593 Literally.
6192355001503598 Is our perception wrong?
6192355001503599 That's a lot of long words. I'm lost.
6192355001503597 Great question. You're an astute man, Doctor 布拉克… Just like your 父亲.\nTime is more complicated than we think. We perceive it as homogenous, uniform, and continuous. The key word being "perceive."
6192355001503601 Heliocentrism was discovered in ancient times.
6192355001503602 Time does move strange in our town.
6192355001503600 There was a time when people believed the Sun rotated around an immobile Earth. It was obvious, wasn't it? Only, our eyes deceived us.\nThe same is true for time. It has many uncharted pores.
6192355001503604 By building cathedrals?
6192355001503603 I never claimed otherwise. I was just illustrating my belief that human perception is limited. The poverty of our mind skews much in our eyes.\nFortunately, we can overcome it.
6192355001503606 And a bell that tolls every hour.
6192355001503607 Yeah. All of them similar, too. A mass-produced shipment from the outside world?
6192355001503608 Same as everywhere.
6192355001503605 Have you noticed how many clocks there are in the Town?
6192355001503610 If that was true, one could bargain with time. But I'm always running short on time, always late…
6192355001503611 …Yeah. I've noticed.
6192355001503609 All of these clocks are small Cathedrals. They don't measure time; they weave it. Time coils into loops beside them. Have you noticed?\nLike a hive. A queen makes larvae. Worker bees cradle, transport, and manage them. The Cathedral produces time. The clocks distribute it.
6192355001503614 So you made them? You have good reason to be proud, then.
6192355001503615 Yet you could have opened a school.
6192355001503612 These clocks are the best I've ever done for our town.
6192355000321252 
6192355000338851 维克多·凯恩
6192355001258469 维克多·凯恩
6192355000004093 What are you doing here, pretty girl?
6192355000004128 How about letting the tenants back in and asking them?
6192355000004129 I remember when you were just a kid. Who could have thought you'd grow into… <i>this?</i>
6192355000004092 You poor, poor house… In a way, your kind are like teeth. You know how they pull teeth out? Sometimes, a dead tooth can be left in place. Other times, it needs immediate extraction.\nDo you think this one needs…?
6192355000004131 What is that supposed to mean?
6192355000004132 So the cross on the door is your doing?
6192355000004130 Don't "pretty girl" me, you peasant. Shoo! Wait outside until I finish.\nIt won't take long now. This house is inessential and ugly. I'm crossing it off.
6192355000004134 So you're planning to demolish this house? On what grounds?
6192355000004135 Victor harshly punishes anyone who interferes with the sanitary procedures.
6192355000004136 "Cocoon man"?
6192355000004133 I'm not talking to you, <i>cocoon man.</i>\nDon't get mad at me, dear house, but you have to go. It's not the people who need curing, but the Town itself. Too much filler. That's the cause of the outbreak. Oh, house… If you're still alive, if you still hear me, I sincerely hope you'll understand.
6192355000004138 But you've got all that in spades. Enough of your games.
6192355000004144 I think you meant "goon," not "cocoon." The former fits me better. Get out.
6192355000004137 Well, you're no butterfly, are you? No wings. No color. No imagination.
6192355000004140 I'm sorry, too, but I <i>will</i> put an end to what you're doing.
6192355000004145 Truly your mother's daughter.
6192355000004146 Yes, pretty girl, you must obey the rules. You'll learn that soon enough.
6192355000004139 Get a load of this, dear house! This man must be a complete fool. He thinks I follow anyone's rules.\n…But you can't hear me, can you? You're unwanted. Unliving. So I hereby sentence you to emptiness. I'm sorry.
6192355000004142 You clearly weren't spanked enough as a child. That can be fixed.
6192355000004143 As will your 父亲.
6192355000004141 On the grounds that I hate it. Be so kind as to shut your trap. Your coarse voice distracts me. Your hideous smell troubles me.\nYour smell… Blood, formaldehyde, iron, as expected. Steppe herbs, surprise, wrath… Oh, would you look at that! This beast is getting angry!
6192355000771966 Yes. 妮娜 was very beautiful.
6192355001433318 I think this is the first time you haven't yelled at me.
6192355001433319 I thought the 凯恩s appreciated architecture.
6192355000771965 …So beautiful.\nSometimes, stone seems useless. Anything is better than stone. Wax, silk, glass… Stone is for the tone-deaf. But occasionally, it shines—even in this crude configuration…
6192355001433321 Try hot iron. Or dumping boiling water on people's faces.
6192355001433322 妮娜 never shied away from people.
6192355001433323 Fine. I won't harass you.
6192355001433320 Oh, be silent. Why do you keep talking to me? Why do you think you're allowed to? No one <i>dared</i> harass Mother like that, but people like you are drawn to me. How can I teach you a lesson?
6192355001433325 Thanks, beautiful. I like you too.
6192355001433326 Can't you 凯恩s live without <i>pressuring</i> people?
6192355001433324 …But you see, Mother, this is precisely what makes it interesting. I don't want to move to the other side of the Gorkhon. It's too easy to step over the past. I don't like things too <i>easy.</i>\nThere are still so many people like this one here. Rough and dirty, ready be pressured into diamonds. All I need is a forge…
6192355001433328 If you need a volunteer to train with, let me know. I'd be happy to oblige.
6192355001433329 Crimson. Yes. 妮娜 was Dark, but you're Crimson.
6192355001433327 …And you know, Mother, that forge is <i>me.</i> Sometimes I wake up with a burning in my chest, and the sky becomes crimson. In that very moment, if I kiss someone, they can see it too. It's true.\nThough I must admit, the first person I tried that on got insomnia and died a week later. But I'll try harder next time…
6192355001440152 People often visit Mistresses. And here…
6192355001440153 I like this place. It's soothing.
6192355001440151 Why have you come?
6192355001120652 I… got here by accident. Lost my way.
6192355001140975 I was looking for 鲁宾. He's upstairs, waiting for you.
6192355001140976 I was looking for the Judge.
6192355001120651 What are you doing here?
6192355001140978 Will you ever summon me…?
6192355001140979 Don't get cheeky with me, girl. I'm not…
6192355001140977 No one enters this house uninvited. Get lost. And do not return unless summoned.
6192355001448754 Yeah… People keep saying that.
6192355001451051 Huh. I can't smell it anymore, myself. Got used to it, I guess.
6192355001451060 I'm a doctor. Here to check up on you.
6192355001448753 You reek of meat, man of heavy hands. And of blood. And misfortune…
6192355001509656 西蒙 was old.
6192355001535835 Really?
6192355001509655 You're too late, doctor. Should have come two weeks ago, when Uncle 西蒙 was still alive. Now, nothing can be fixed.
6192355001535821 I'm sorry about your loss. You're mourning 西蒙?
6192355001535822 As expected from 妮娜 凯恩娜's daughter…
6192355001535820 Come to think of it, we have a lot in common. I reek of misfortune, too. Our whole house does.
6192355001535824 Huh. Unexpected words from the 凯恩s' heiress…
6192355001535825 You're asking the wrong questions. You've had your life, and that's enough. How old are you, even? Early twenties?
6192355001535823 Today, I dreamt of Earth… I went to a cemetery barefoot, for some reason. I saw human bones in the snowmelt, down below my feet.\n为什么？ What was the purpose of my life?
6192355001535827 Just don't follow her directly.
6192355001535828 I never believed in all that Mistress nonsense.
6192355001535826 西蒙's gone… Uncle Georgiy can't protect us. Mother is dead. And 父亲… Ugh, 父亲.\nAnd me? Who am I? I need to be like Mother, do what she did. Oh, no plague would dare touch us while she lived. She was a true Mistress.
6192355001535830 How come?
6192355001555151 There's all kinds of joy in the world. You're just sheltered.
6192355001535829 You never believed? <i>You never believed?</i> Who in this world cares what you believe!\nA Mistress brings to life all that her hands, words, and thoughts touch. Like the ancient king who turned water, bread, and trees into gold. Only, his touch ruined life; a Mistress' touch animates. There's no greater joy.
6192355001535832 I do. Stop shouting.
6192355001535831 A Mistress holds a doll in her hands, and it comes to life. The Mistress thinks, and the doll remembers seven generations of its history. The Mistress dreams, and the doll acquires creativity.\nDo you understand now, heavy man reeking of blood and guts?
6192355001535834 A doctor.
6192355001535836 A person who has lived longer than you, and seen more.
6192355001535833 Who do you think you are, talking to me as if we are equals?
6192355001535838 You are a Mistress all right. By blood, if not in spirit.
6192355001535839 Live some more. Perhaps you'll grow into it.
6192355001535840 Nothing. Although… what about working as a nurse?
6192355001535837 This plague came after me… to challenge me. Am I a Mistress yet? But no! I'm not… Ah, what do I do…
6192355001535842 Yet at some point, you will.
6192355001535843 So don't. Aren't you a 凯恩娜?
6192355001535844 Neither did 西蒙. He did truly seem like an immortal man…
6192355001535841 I don't want to die…
6192355000450351 玛利亚 凯恩娜
6192355001271557 玛利亚 凯恩娜
6192355001374464 
6192355000012781 Your master can rot for all I care.
6192355000012782 父亲 could do it, I think.
6192355000012783 What should I do, Reflection?
6192355000012780 Fear tightly grips my master, sir. He wishes, as you so frightf'ly know, to keep you close at hand, so that you may be near his children. 'Tis just in case. But we know it won't help: No one can cure the sand plague.
6192355000012785 Speak, Reflection.
6192355000012786 I don't care. I refused my legacy.
6192355000012784 布拉克, I reckon… It will be you who saves us from this pest. Who saves those who survive to witness your triumph. Your name's 布拉克; so I know you'll wear out your fingers working. By the by, mind the fund he spoke of earlier… You should know how it works.
6192355000012788 That's nice to hear.
6192355000012789 But money is depreciating as we speak…
6192355000012792 How will he know of my actions?
6192355000012787 A doctor like yourself is paid each night with some fair sum we take from the Pest Fund. Whether our Master likes or loathes you. He is, indeed, a man whose word is bond. Stay at the lump or not: The Fund will pay you for your deeds.
6192355000012794 I always dreaded notoriety.
6192355000012797 I don't need attention. At all.
6192355000012793 The Fund is not cared for purely by Master. All hands in town have staked on its success. You doctors will be watched closely…
6192355000012796 I know.
6192355000012801 Really?
6192355000012795 Inflation will be tallied up with care. There's yet plenty of heft to Master's purse, and more gold yet from 凯恩s and 萨普洛夫s: They share in the Bull Enterprise.
6192355000012799 Not at all. Too much rambling for one evening…
6192355000012802 Yes. I can't stand being ignored.
6192355000012798 The founders of the Fund will find all faults; count up your deeds each night. The more you work the more you make… in hospital or street. Though I know not what they expect of you; mayhaps neither do they. Are you certain you wish to talk to them?
6192355000449759 大 维拉德's Reflection
6192355001374233 
6192355000651852 Thanks, Judge. I know what part of town is called Earth.
6192355000651853 Perhaps it won't cross the Gullet after all. Perhaps they'll barricade the bridges in time.
6192355000651894 …What does that mean for me?
6192355000651851 It's spreading across Earth—the lower Town. Between the Gullet and the屠宰场.
6192355000651855 为什么？
6192355000651856 I don't even know them.
6192355000917824 I've already visited Peter.
6192355000917825 I've spoken to 安德烈 just recently. He is safe.
6192355000917828 You needn't worry, Judge. The brothers are safe.
6192355000651854 Two architects live in Earth: 安德烈 and 彼得 斯塔马丁. Both geniuses, each in his own way. Please, take them into your care. You could let the whole Town die, but these two must survive!
6192355000651858 Where do they live?
6192355000651859 Why don't <i>you</i> take care of them, then?
6192355000651857 Because you won't find minds like theirs anywhere else on the whole continent. We hunted them for much too long. \nMy brother 西蒙 collected many brilliant specimens in this town, you know. It is an ark.
6192355000651861 All right. I'll keep an eye on them.
6192355000651862 Yes, an oath to all people. Not just to your handful of chosen ones.
6192355000651860 You are a doctor. You took the oath.
6192355000651864 I know that place—it's a twyrine den. I had no idea it's run by a genius.
6192355000651866 I'll take a look.
6192355000651863 Peter lives in a loft in the Tanners. 安德烈, though, rarely leaves the 破碎之心—his pub below the Factory. \nI put my hopes on you, doctor. Pay them a visit as soon as you can.
6192355000917827 Very well.
6192355000917826 I need both alive and well. Those two are a single creature. Each one of them is stunted without the other.
6192355000917830 I should have returned earlier. That way we'd still have the best doctor we could hope for.
6192355000917831 Thank you for your kind words, Judge. Only time will tell how good a doctor I really am.
6192355000917829 You're a good doctor, 布拉克. You've returned home at an evil hour, but still in time.
6192355000651868 How can I help, Judge?
6192355000651869 People get sick and die. It's medical, all right.
6192355000651867 The strict sanitary measures… 为什么？ Will they help us maintain decency? This isn't plague, cholera, or pox. It's not some unstudied strain of flu. I have a suspicion that this is not a medical affliction at all.
6192355000651871 I barely remember anything about my heritage anymore.
6192355000651872 The Kin consider me an outsider.
6192355000651873 Who cares?
6192355000651870 You are a steppe man. This affliction is clearly a steppe thing. In this situation, I'd rather rely on 布拉克's son than on 丹考夫斯基, even though he's a big-city star. The roots of this place go back to the Kin. To the ground. Or so I should think.
6192355000651875 Look, I'm not a philosopher.
6192355000651876 I would love to be your student, Judge.
6192355000651877 We'll see if we survive.
6192355000651874 This entity has a purpose. A will. It wants something from us. It plays by some kind of rules. But what are those rules? How do you understand earth? Nature? These things—they speak a language that had been extinct long before we humans even stepped forth on the stage of Creation.
6192355000771952 Is it time to take off?
6192355001415607 Can't we just have a normal town, for normal living people?
6192355001446902 More engineering metaphors…
6192355000771951 I feared this town might be a cradle. But it ended up being a catapult bucket.
6192355001415610 You mean… You know everything?
6192355001415611 That vaccination cost you the Polyhedron.
6192355001651766 父亲 vaccinated the town? What are you talking about?
6192355001415609 西蒙 was better than me. He did what I never had the courage to do: thrust a knife into his own firstborn. He couldn't bear the infant's scream, but still…\nStill, he succeeded. 西蒙 凯恩 and 伊西多 布拉克 vaccinated our town against death.
6192355001415613 I thought you stored something precious inside that bottle… but whatever.
6192355001415622 I'm glad we agree on this, Judge.
6192355001415623 I always knew that, deep down, you didn't really love our town. And that one day, you'd abandon it.
6192355001415612 The Polyhedron was a glass bottle. A clepsydra. A compass. A work of exquisite craftsmanship… but merely a tool, like this town. The first of the many steps on this ladder.
6192355001415615 …And not a single word for the person who actually saved them.
6192355001415616 But even more are dead.
6192355001415617 Maybe you're right… about the purpose.
6192355001415614 My brother and I have been preparing to face a catastrophe like this for many years. We knew that only people whose lives were imbued with meaning and purpose could survive it. People with bowstrings for souls.\n…I never imagined that there'd be so many survivors. Truly, we live in the best of possible worlds.
6192355001415619 My dreams are bitter, too.
6192355001415620 It's called "love," Judge.
6192355001415621 Perhaps you'll be at peace on the other side of the river.
6192355001415618 We ascended—one step. A single step, but a crucial one. The mission of House 凯恩 on this side of the river is over.\n…So why does 西蒙, my dear twin brother, still haunt me in my sleep?
6192355001415625 Love hurts, huh?
6192355001415626 …I know.
6192355001415624 I loved it less than 西蒙 did.
6192355001446904 So considerate of you, Judge.
6192355001446903 I meant an onager, of course, to be more precise. I just used the word "catapult" to make the idea easier to digest.
6192355001446906 Yeah… It's unwise to get into arguments with you.
6192355001446905 No. What is a "normal person," anyway? What is the "norm"? Think it over, dear Haruspex, lest you blurt out something really ignorant and find yourself in an awkward position.
6192355001446908 Why do you want to… propel humanity forward? And where? The coldness of space?
6192355001446909 Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.
6192355001446907 Or other kinds of fights, young man.
6192355001446911 父亲… He didn't do it on purpose.
6192355001446912 Your brother… He and my 父亲…
6192355001446910 Of course. For I am the Judge.
6192355001446914 I mean, it was bound to happen one way or another.
6192355001446915 This plague would come back to haunt us anyway!
6192355001446913 Of course he did.
6192355001446917 I guess.
6192355001446918 Yes.
6192355001446916 Correct. And the great people who guarded our town against it before were withering and dying. There was no time to waste.
6192355001651768 Is your Polyhedron a thing of the past, too?
6192355001651769 Yeah... it's my own fault. I failed to do everything.
6192355001651770 In that case, go to hell.
6192355001651767 Oh, so you haven't figured it out? Well... I suppose it's fair. The past is a complicated material, capricious and hard to bend. Not all people know how to work with it—and uncover it.\nWe will not talk of this matter.
6192355000850098 How do you know?
6192355000934553 I am.
6192355000934554 Greetings, Judge.
6192355000850097 You're 阿泰米 布拉克.
6192355000934552 So, I gather you already know why I'm here?
6192355001065719 Is that so? I didn't know. You… surprised me.
6192355000934551 I saw you several times before. When you were a child, my brother 西蒙 was close to your 父亲. One could say they were friends.
6192355000934556 That's all it took…?
6192355000934559 Why did you want our house in the first place?
6192355000934555 About the house. Now, after I've seen you with my own eyes, I relinquish all claims I have on your property. The house is yours.
6192355000934558 Thank you, Judge.
6192355001065722 Why today?
6192355000934557 I'm going to write a decree. Pass it to the prefect of the Hindquarters district. Today, of course.
6192355000934561 What did you have in store for my home?
6192355001065743 I don't get it. I didn't expect to, either.
6192355000934560 We 凯恩s are a family of builders. We built this town. Every house adds something unique to it's image. We… let's say we keep track of this process.
6192355001065721 I confess I don't know much about the 凯恩s. Still, I believe that my 父亲 and your brother were as different as people can get.
6192355001065728 I didn't have any secrets from 父亲. It is strange that I wasn't aware of their friendship. Very strange.
6192355001065720 Elaborate.
6192355001065724 But… 为什么？ This sounds inconvenient.
6192355001065723 Those are the rules. The Judge's decision is executed on the same day it's made.
6192355001065726 Now I understand.
6192355001065727 I'll never understand you. Your family, I mean.
6192355001065725 Convenience is poison. One must accustom themselves to pursue any intention as soon as it appears, regardless of difficulty. Otherwise one burns out, gives in to doubt, starts fearing oneself. The bolder the dream, the more surely it becomes dust when the moment is lost.
6192355001065730 Intriguing. May I ask you something else?
6192355001065729 They both cared about the fate of our town. Your 父亲 was all about the people who live in the Lower Town. He wanted to protect the Kin. \n西蒙 basically invented our town… Designed it. Planned it out like a machine. A special space unlike any other. I think they were brought together by this shared responsibility for the future.
6192355001065732 What was my 父亲's plan for the Town?
6192355001065733 What was my 父亲's plan for the Kin?
6192355001065734 Did 西蒙 and my 父亲 disagree strongly on something?
6192355001065739 I'll return on Sunday, then. Thank you. What about the house?
6192355001065731 I will answer a single question. First off, I am quite busy right now. Secondly, my brother wasn't too forthcoming to me concerning his relationship with your 父亲. This was strange to me, too. \nCome visit me on Sunday, and I will tell you more.
6192355001065736 I understand. Thank you for your answer.
6192355001065742 I'll think about what you said.
6192355001065735 As far as I know, both of them were concerned about the Town turning out being too extraordinary. Such peculiar towns don't survive for long, just like peculiar people, or animals with rare mutations. An exotic flower won't last in the wild. Without people like 西蒙, your 父亲, or myself, the Town won't stay the same.
6192355001065741 Where does the Town come into this?
6192355001065740 The Kin are a part of the Town. We live in the age of machines and science. People achieved flight and perform more complex computations every year. \nThe Kin, however, belong to the primal times. Your people think and behave like people did thousands of years ago, when we were barely different from beasts. I hope you are not offended.
6192355001065745 Our house has always been a gloomy place.
6192355001065746 Our house was just a house.
6192355001065747 Is that why you've built so many identical buildings?
6192355001065744 We would have examined it first. Its proportions, the taste of the space inside… Every house transforms everyone who spends more than five minutes within. Sometimes this transformation can be influenced or controlled. We have a great interest in these matters. 
6192355001065749 No.
6192355001067152 I do, but you seem busy. I'll ask at another time.
6192355001065748 Exactly so. They're identical on the outside. We were interested in how much human presence could change them in return. It was an experiment in mirroring. A juxtaposition of natures. Do you want to ask me anything else?
6192355001432952 Yes. I have.
6192355001538950 父亲 and 西蒙. What did they have in common?
6192355001432951 So you've come…
6192355001540552 What do you mean?
6192355001540554 A bunch of houses on a patch of land.
6192355001560347 I want to know more about 父亲, Judge. About his friendship…
6192355001540551 What is a town?
6192355001540556 I don't know.
6192355001560348 What is a town?
6192355001560349 An organism.
6192355001540555 …What is a town?
6192355001563751 And what would be its purpose?
6192355001563754 You refer to your family, but you're not this town's only builders.
6192355001563757 Still, tell me about 父亲. He was friends with your brother, wasn't he?
6192355001560350 A town is a process. It's movement. More often than not, it's slow and aimless, town creeping across the land like an oil stain.\nWe wanted to make a town that would grow upwards. Quickly. Purposeful.
6192355001563753 Meaning…?
6192355001563760 What work does this machine do, I wonder?
6192355001563761 Are people machines to you, too? Like, machines that produce ideas?
6192355001563752 In this town, people can make the impossible—if they're capable, of course. For it is a machine. A border-breaking machine.
6192355001563756 The other two at least make this town habitable.
6192355001563767 At least the other two pull it back to the ground.
6192355001563755 No, but we are its planners and designers. We shape it.\nThe merits of the three families are inarguable. We live in harmony, even as we pull in different directions—sometimes, commoners mistake that for adversity. Each family does its job. Each is irreplaceable.
6192355001563759 I apologize for my impatience.
6192355001579951 And I'm not staying. Goodbye.
6192355001563758 I <i>am</i> telling you about them. If you're too impatient to hear the answer, I'm not holding you here.
6192355001563763 Such is our nature.
6192355001563764 The body dictates its laws.
6192355001563762 No. People are mere infants, yet to even climb from their cribs. Larvae on the verge of transformation.\nA town is a process. A human is a process. Pointed up and forward, unlike what some would have you think. Past a certain age, certainly, our mind begins to degrade. Why is that?
6192355001563769 The Tower on the other side of the river?
6192355001563768 See the Polyhedron?
6192355001563771 What do you mean?
6192355001563770 No, my friend. That's the issue. It's not yet on the other side, and that is quite symbolic.
6192355001563773 Well… maybe we're fine as we are now?
6192355001563778 Bullshit. This is bullshit, Judge!
6192355001563772 Just like a person, the Town is a process. It grew. From ancient times, imprinted upon the neolithic屠宰场; from the ancient steppe upwards, towards the Gorkhon.\nNow it finds itself pressed against the river—a border. The Town has faced its limit, unable to move forward, unless we do the impossible.
6192355001563775 You're insane…
6192355001563774 It pushes people.\nTo do the impossible. To save themselves from drowning by pulling themselves up by their own hair. To force butterflies from their sad shells. To step over, break, overcome boundaries—of thinking and sensing, first and foremost. The limits of their conception of the world.
6192355001563777 Why are you doing all this?
6192355001563784 The Polyhedron isn't especially pretty… Are you sure it had to be built?
6192355001563785 How does it… remain there?
6192355001563776 The time has come for us to cross to the other side. Even the Polyhedron, defying the law of gravity—one of the most binding architectural laws—is <i>still</i> not there. It stands on an island between the two banks.\nIt is a bridge. We've raised our foot over the abyss, but have yet to step forward. Frozen in the middle, we are. Still, this is a lot.
6192355001563780 It is.
6192355001563781 Is that so…
6192355001563779 This is what my brother and your 父亲 used to talk about. This is the core of their friendship, if you will! Isn't this what you wanted to know?
6192355001563783 So this is what 父亲 and 西蒙 used to talk about…?
6192355001563792 But people don't fly on their own. We use machines.
6192355001563782 This tower proves that any limit can be challenged.\nWe currently believe death is inevitable, just as we once believed human flight to be impossible. But people achieved it, and crossed unimaginable distances. This tower triumphs over the law of earth.
6192355001563787 No. Not interested in engineering.
6192355001563786 Without magic, believe me. Limits can be challenged without miracles; all you need is will and imagination. \nThe rest is technicalities that you're unlikely to understand. Or are you an engineer? Have you studied structural loads?
6192355001563789 Thank you, Judge. That would be enough.
6192355001563790 I won't pretend that I support them.
6192355001563791 I understand. I truly do now.
6192355001563788 They used to discuss the Town, its change and direction. They argued.\nI don't know what your 父亲 believed in. 西蒙… won't tell us anything, not anymore. But I've explained his ideas to you.
6192355001563794 Thank you. I've seen books before, you know.
6192355001563795 How is death overcome, then?
6192355001563793 And death is not overcome in bodily form, else we'd all turn into horrendous struldbrugs, tortured by dementia and feebleness. It was in a certain adventure book, sort of.
6192355001563797 Ah. You have one answer for everything. The 凯恩 answer.
6192355001563796 Perhaps this outbreak will give us an answer.\nDeath comes to those who devolve. Dullness is death. Fading is death. Only constant development of the self can overcome death.
6192355001563799 What 父亲 and your brother had in common, of course. Judging by your words, no two people could be more different…
6192355001563798 Was there anything else you wanted to know?
6192355000321251 
6192355000338852 乔尔基 凯恩
6192355001258455 乔尔基 凯恩
6192355001374454 
6192355000033707 So, you are a living thing after all?
6192355000033712 Oh, yes.
6192355000033713 I'm not here to pick a fight. I'm here to help the sick.
6192355000033706 And what do you do now, I wonder? Seek a salve that will slay me? Oh, you dear, warm being… Are you sure you want to challenge me, earthly man?
6192355000033711 Never would I have guessed that.
6192355000033720 Is that so? And yet, all you touch dies.
6192355000033710 Indeed. I am life itself.
6192355000033715 Do <i>you?</i>
6192355000033716 Everyone loves life.
6192355000033714 Well said, 布拉克! Indeed you know the Lines, if you see this clearly. You are no fool, unlike that 学者, or the 换生灵. There is no helping them see truth. You, however, love life dearly.
6192355000033718 I'm making a cure.
6192355000033719 I'm not telling <i>you.</i>
6192355000033717 And what is the next step in this plot you weave? I would like to know.
6192355000033722 This one might fail. The next one… who knows?
6192355000033723 There are other organic components out there. Something might work.
6192355000033724 Life finds a way, always. Sooner or later I'll find something to defeat you.
6192355000033721 You jest, surely? You are like a bairn making stew from sod and bones. \nWhat was that red stuff? Guts from menfolk? Bah! Man-guts won't do, 布拉克, oh no. Your bodies are weak. Try your foolish potion on someone, and you will see that it is worthless.
6192355000033726 I don't mean to test <i>every</i> combination of ingredients.
6192355000033727 It won't take that long.
6192355000033728 You're much simpler than you like to think.
6192355000033725 You mean to test everything you can find? What wisdom! You should be done in forty years, if you live to reach such an age. \nI might cut short your woe, for I am not without kindness. The fool will die, and the wise shall receive my help.
6192355000033731 There must be something that affects all of your strains.
6192355000033732 You're lying, I can feel it. Get lost, I have a potion to test.
6192355000033733 All right. I'll give you a head start. Get lost.
6192355000033730 I do not stand still, menkhu. I shift, and shift quickly. Will you race me?
6192355000375671 Hopefully.
6192355000375672 We'll see about that. Soon.
6192355000375673 So that's what it is? Thanks for the hint!
6192355001653555 Seems so.
6192355000375670 My, my, my, what have we here? A real cure? To drive me out of the body?
6192355000375675 Really? Did he also make a panacea?
6192355000375676 What did he do?
6192355000375677 I'm very happy to follow his path.
6192355000375674 You are just like your foolish 父亲. Following in his footsteps. Doing what he did, five years ago.
6192355000375679 Sounds like a job well done.
6192355000375680 Cruel. My solution is more humane.
6192355000375678 He did not let me into the Town. Boarded off the Crude Sprawl. It burned out from the inside, to the last soul. With no food, I starved to death. And so the Town returned to its unknowing slumber.
6192355000375683 Just admit it: You're scared.
6192355000375684 Yes, it is. To poison you.
6192355000375685 In five years, perhaps I will regret this. For now, step aside.
6192355000375682 That was a long time ago. He then had time to think of what happened. To understand that one should not drive me away… Neither from a town, nor from a body.\nI am a heavenly gift, 布拉克! Will you also take five years to understand it? You hold poison in your hands!
6192355000377751 
6192355000474551 ???
6192355000068061 What's going on?
6192355000068074 I'm busy, kid. Find someone else to bother.
6192355000068079 Was someone else poisoned?
6192355000068060 诺克金 asks you to come by, big bear. Looks like our troubles hunt in packs.
6192355000068063 How'd he even find you all?
6192355000068064 What do you mean, pills will kill him?
6192355000068065 Did he tell you anything else?
6192355000068062 One of our lads, Patches, came down with somethin' nasty. He's burning up, won't last long. That dandy doctor from the Capital examined him. Told us the pills would kill him for sure.
6192355000068067 So why didn't he help?
6192355000068072 Tell 诺克金 I'm on my way.
6192355000068066 Dunno, he just came sniffing about. Was looking for something. In the walls, in the kennels, even in the air.
6192355000068069 Antibiotics.
6192355000068077 I'm no therapist.
6192355000068068 How should I know? He was rambling on about them being old and stale and 'tibiotic or something. That guy is a worthless fraud, he is. Wants to board us up inside our hideout and let us rot.
6192355000068071 So why didn't the dandy help you?
6192355000068073 Tell 诺克金 I'm on my way.
6192355000068070 He said our place should be locked up, so we don't spread whatever Patches got. Maybe it's catching? If you ask me, I think Patches just ate some moldy crackers…
6192355000068076 We'll see.
6192355000068078 Quit it with the praise already.
6192355000109275 I'll have to brew a little something, first… Can he make it three hours?
6192355000068075 诺克金 told us: "Go and find the younger 布拉克. If anyone can make sense of this mess, it's 伊西多之子. That fancy weasel only thinks about boarding us up, so 布拉克's our only hope."
6192355000143056 That's all the time I need.
6192355000143057 Run along. I'll be there soon.
6192355000143055 The black-coat said Patches has until the evening to live. Not even until the nightfall!
6192355000267051 Scout
6192355001374234 
6192355000345352 Why would I need these?
6192355000345353 You're nuts.
6192355000345354 You've killed someone and cut them open, odongh. Is that so?
6192355000345351 For you, emshen. Heart, liver, 肾脏s. They still smell of life.
6192355000345356 I don't need these.
6192355000345357 This is punishable by death. Don't you know?
6192355000345358 Only a menkhu can cut a body. Is there a menkhu among you?
6192355000345355 Make potions, as your 父亲. Cures from 格里夫, poison, envy, aches. He made any cure when he had good meat. This is good meat. Take it.
6192355000345360 What makes you think I need these?
6192355000345359 Yes, emshen. We do not pity ourselves. 布拉克-esegher is already there. We'll follow behind him, then arrive, then be companions. We are content to do this. \nSegne dehe, take these. You'll save many lives.
6192355000345362 But what does it have to do with me?
6192355000345363 What kind of cures?
6192355000345361 You do need these, yargachin. Real potions have meat, unente. \nHerbs have borders. Your great 父亲 used more than herbs. He made cures from blood and flesh, from those alive.
6192355000345365 But 为什么？
6192355000345364 No, yargachin. We have broken the law. Those who do not know the Lines cannot cut bodies. We will give our lives, mine and Kooseh. No others.
6192355000345367 Bayarlaa. I accept your gift, and your sacrifice.
6192355000345368 If my medicine ever needs organs, I'll get them myself. Remember that, and tell the others.
6192355000345369 Fat 维拉德 is right. You're a bunch of beasts.
6192355000345366 These are a gift, so you don't risk your life. Don't cut the living unless there is need. Don't cut the dead unless there is need. Even if you're a good menkhu, Boddho does not like it. \nBetter we suffer than you.
6192355000345372 I'm not 父亲. I can't make those kinds of cures. Take these organs back.
6192355000345373 So it's a universal method? Curious…
6192355000345374 How do you know about the three Layers?
6192355000345370 Any kind. Cures for pain, cures for fever, cures for the inner fire. Cures for all three Layers of the body. \nThose who know the Lines can cure any disease with guts and herbs. This is how the world works.
6192355000345376 …Nerves. Those "threads" are called nerves.
6192355000345377 …Yet he sent me away to learn from those with different views.
6192355000345375 Skin. Blood. Thin threads. Your 父亲 treated with those.

6192355000126661 What's that supposed to mean?
6192355000126659 I come to you, yargachin, with news. 萨巴 has died so you may live.
6192355000126663 I'm sorry.
6192355000126662 Our leader. Our protector. Our teacher. She loved your 父亲, yargachin.
6192355000126665 What children? What are you talking about, Worm?
6192355000126666 Damn it! I wasn't fast enough!
6192355000126664 The children waited for your help, the help of a 布拉克. You let them down. In honor of your name, 萨巴 did your work. It didn't go well. She paid with her life.
6192355000126668 Bish. I do not want to.
6192355000127475 I know best what my 父亲 would want from me.
6192355000126667 You are lost, yargachin. You misunderstand fate. You misunderstand your place in the Kin. Your role is 伊西多's role. Become his heir, shuu dee.
6192355001137251 Got it, Worm.
6192355000126670 Got it, Worm.
6192355000126669 You have been crowned heir. Thank 萨巴. You can avoid fate, but others will carry the burden. And it may break them, as it broke 萨巴.
6192355000126675 Bayarlaa. Now leave.
6192355000127476 I can. And you can't force me to decide.
6192355000126674 I am to give you the udhar that contains your inheritance. Here it is. You can turn away from it, if you want. But if you do, do not be shocked when everything around you ceases to make sense.
6192355001599562 萨巴? Who is that?
6192355001599563 Why hasn't she come herself?
6192355001599568 I'm listening.
6192355001599561 I came here to talk to you on 萨巴's behalf, yargachin. I am her rough hand, her wise heart, her heavy word.
6192355001599565 I was busy.
6192355001599570 Somehow, I felt like this disease couldn't touch her.
6192355001599564 She's in her hut. The plague speaks to her. She was waiting for you here, but you took too long to come.
6192355001599567 Why hasn't she come herself?
6192355001599569 Wow…
6192355001599566 萨巴 Usp'tae. 艾斯佩蒂. Our leader. Our protector. Our teacher. She loved your 父亲, yargachin.
6192355001599572 I don't need your acknowledgment. I <i>am</i> a 布拉克.
6192355001599573 This is what matters.
6192355001599574 I don't need your acknowledgment. I <i>am</i> a 布拉克.
6192355001599575 This is what matters.
6192355001599571 萨巴 would have said many words, wise words. I am bad at speech. My words are simple.\nYou have come into your 父亲's inheritance. You are a menkhu. The Kin acknowledge you as a 布拉克.

6192355000146852 Just the milkman. Don't mind me.
6192355000146853 你是谁? You look weird.
6192355000146854 阿泰米 布拉克. Surgeon.
6192355000146851 你是谁?
6192355000146856 Where's 丹尼尔 丹考夫斯基? He's staying here, right?
6192355000146855 你想要什么？ You look like you can hardly read. And I doubt you're into stargazing.
6192355000146858 Why so rude? Where's your hospitality?
6192355000146859 My name is 阿泰米. Are we acquainted now?
6192355000146860 I'm 布拉克. Local doctor. You must have heard of me.
6192355000146857 Why would I introduce myself first? I don't talk to strangers.
6192355000146862 Well… Things don't always turn out right. 
6192355000146863 Oh, like you've seen a lot of wolves. Outside of books.
6192355000146861 You lie. I know 布拉克. He's twenty-five years older than you, and kind. And you smell of blood, like a wolf.
6192355000146865 Is that so? I remember a time when this observatory actually was used.
6192355000146866 So this is like… the 凯恩s' guesthouse?
6192355000146867 I guess you just appeared here spontaneously, huh?
6192355000146864 I'm Eva. Eva Yan. I've been allowed to live here for as long as I'd like.
6192355000146870 Who's that walking upstairs, then? Pacing impatiently? Waiting for me?
6192355000146871 Why would he set up our meeting here, then?
6192355000146922 You're a bad liar, sweetheart. I think I'll take a look upstairs.
6192355000146869 He… he isn't here. And he isn't coming. He's gone to the 城镇大厅. For a meeting. An important meeting. With doctors.
6192355000146874 Uh huh. Could've guessed that myself.
6192355000146879 Pretty huge mice, huh? You must be an excellent chef.
6192355000146873 Just mice… No, I mean… uh… ghosts! Restless souls! There are lots of them here.
6192355000146921 Stop shaking. We need to talk business.
6192355000146920 He couldn't! He didn't! And you know what? You're not welcome in this house!
6192355000146924 So he's off to the 城镇大厅, huh?
6192355000146925 Mice indeed. Sorry I didn't believe you.
6192355000146930 Something isn't right here.
6192355000146923 Happy now? Don't ever do that again.
6192355000146929 Right. One can tell at a glance that he's an avid theatregoer.
6192355000146931 …With some doctors, yes. I suppose that would be me.
6192355000146932 Well, off to the 城镇大厅.
6192355000146928 Uh huh. To the 城镇大厅. And then to the Theatre… He said he had an… important appointment…
6192355000770384 Many generations worked on this town before all the 安德烈s, Peters, and Farkhads came along.
6192355001415647 The Oneirotects?
6192355000770383 People always say it was 安德烈 and Peter who built this town, but that's not true. The Oneirotects did. And 妮娜 and 维多利亚 too, in their own way…\nAnd then there was Farkhad, another Oneirotect. He built the Cathedral.
6192355001415646 So did I.
6192355001415860 One stroll around the Crude Sprawl and you'd see just how interesting it can be.
6192355001415645 I meant the interesting parts of the Town.
6192355001415649 Says the girl living in the abandoned observatory.
6192355001415861 Dingy, but alive.
6192355001415648 You're talking about the dingy part of the Town. Dingy and chaotic. Messy. <i>Our</i> town has no place for unnecessary things.
6192355001415851 How is it unfinished? It looks finished to me.
6192355001415862 And useless.
6192355001415650 Anyway, things went wrong with the Cathedral, somehow. It remained unfinished.
6192355001415853 Is that so?
6192355001446901 That's so strange… So many strong and resolute people have died, yet a daisy like you survives…
6192355001415852 It's empty and silent. Soulless. A week ago, I had a dream. I was walking down its aisle… or rather, falling. I woke up and thought… Ah, it doesn't matter.\nYou know, I think the 凯恩s might take me with them when they leave for the other side. Us standing here together… it just feels right. They know I'm one of them.
6192355001415855 Congratulations on the new job.
6192355001415856 Well… good luck, girl with a soul.
6192355001415854 We'll build a new town across the river! Iridescent, and specular, and transparent… Well, they'll build it. I'll just listen and tell them if they've gone too flat or too sharp. 
6192355001446883 你是谁?
6192355001446884 You're dressed strangely.
6192355001446882 Come over here.
6192355001446886 Oh!
6192355001446895 What do you have here?
6192355001446885 I live in the Stillwater.
6192355001446888 I think I saw you before…
6192355001446887 So are you.
6192355001446890 So what are they saying?
6192355001446892 Haven't they built enough? The Town already strangles the Gorkhon.
6192355001446889 They're discussing what they're planning to build next. And I'm listening. So interesting!
6192355001446894 So what about that… grand construction project?
6192355001446893 I guess.
6192355001446897 Should've spent more time working on the vaccine instead.
6192355001446898 You two were close, weren't you?
6192355001446896 I don't know, either. So interesting! 丹尼尔 was fascinated by it, too. He kept asking around, looking at documents…
6192355001446900 Anyway. This town existed long before those Oneirotects.
6192355001446899 I guess.
6192355001448758 Don't. It's fine as is.
6192355001448759 Your interest in local history is commendable.
6192355001448757 It's empty and silent. Soulless. A week ago, I had a dream. I was walking down its aisle… or rather, falling. I woke up and thought… Ah, it doesn't matter.\nAnyway, I'm curious about what exactly went wrong with Farkhard's plan, and if the Cathedral can be fixed. I'll ask around.
6192355001362378 Wait… I've seen you in the Stillwater.
6192355001439267 Өөriy kheleer yar, basaghan.
6192355001439268 You are, but in the wrong company. You're playing with fire.
6192355001362377 "Urmaan, urmaan, urmaan." Am I singing it right?
6192355001439270 So you want to be an 草药新娘?
6192355001439271 Shi yuunde ereebshe? Go home.
6192355001439269 What? I don't know <i>that</i> many words yet.
6192355001446869 Because they're dangerous. They'll eat you.
6192355001446868 What do you mean?
6192355001446871 As soon as you finish that charming melody.
6192355001446872 During your first dance.
6192355001446873 Why…? Because that's the steppe way. Go home, girl. Don't play with fire.
6192355001446870 What do you mean… eat me? 为什么？ When?
6192355001446875 And why the hell are you here?
6192355001446881 So you want to be an 草药新娘?
6192355001446874 Yeah… That's where I live.
6192355001446877 Not sure it's to your benefit.
6192355001446878 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai!
6192355001446876 You know, I've always felt torn… Drawn to the steppe, to the herbs, to dreams of dancing with the Brides… But also to the Cathedral. I'm not sure why—I guess it's my fate?\nSo I stayed home, neither here nor there… and <i>now</i> look! It's all come together!
6192355001446880 It means "Attagirl!" You're walking a dangerous line here.
6192355001446879 What…?
6192355001448756 Clearly I have nothing better to do than teach you steppe-walking.
6192355001451857 You have no business in the steppe, town flower. What are you? A daisy? A forget-me-not?
6192355001526513 You look strange… Cover yourself a bit, maybe?
6192355001448755 You're a steppe man, aren't you? You're Kin? Tell me how to walk the steppe right.
6192355001451856 
6192355001451855 
6192355001451863 为什么？
6192355001538866 No, little girl… I'm a thistle.
6192355001451859 A daisy, I guess… You must be a bitterroot.
6192355001509652 
6192355001509653 
6192355001509654 
6192355001509651 
6192355001526515 What do you mean? It's… well, polite to do.
6192355001526516 You'd make a good 草药新娘. They see clothes as a hindrance, too.
6192355001526514 What for?
6192355001538865 I'm not bitter.
6192355001538867 That was surprisingly apt.
6192355001538868 "Bitterroot." Gotta keep that in mind. 劳拉 would love this.
6192355001538864 Because you're bitter, and rooted here.
6192355001538870 Go ahead.
6192355001538871 No. I have enough of my own.
6192355001538869 Want me to tell you a dream I had?
6192355001538873 Don't put faith in dreams, daisy. You see all sorts of things in your sleep.
6192355001538874 I think they were your bones, forget-me-not.
6192355001538875 Whose bones were they, bellflower? Your tenant's?
6192355001538872 I dreamt of Earth… A cemetery. Not ours—a different one, in a big city.\nI walked through it barefoot. Then I saw them there, in the snowmelt: the bones. I realized they were his beloved bones… Or maybe my own, even… 为什么？ What was the purpose of my life?
6192355001538877 Really?
6192355001538878 How are you so special?
6192355001538879 So you're all dressed up for it?
6192355001538876 This plague came after me…
6192355001538881 I want to find my calling, and fulfill it. Wait, no… That sounds pompous.
6192355001538882 No, I don't.
6192355001538883 I would have never come back here if I knew.
6192355001538884 I want to find my roots. That's my purpose.
6192355001538885 You really are strange…
6192355001538880 I'm good for nothing. Worthless. I don't know my own purpose. Do you?
6192355001538887 You must? No, you don't. So don't.
6192355001538888 But you'll have to.
6192355001538889 丹考夫斯基 does that? Well, it's his area of expertise. If he laughs, it must be because you <i>will</i> live forever.
6192355001538886 You know… I tried to tell him, but he only laughs it off… I don't want to die! I know I must, but… but I don't want to.
6192355000261452 Eva Yan
6192355001258454 Eva Yan
6192355000146881 No way. I'm not waiting, I'm going in.
6192355000146882 你是谁?
6192355000146880 Doctor 丹考夫斯基 ordered us to meet him here, by the house he's staying at. We've been waiting for half an hour, but he still isn't coming out. Meaning he's busy. So we wait. You will too.
6192355000146884 The man clearly has theatrical ambitions. Why did he make you wear… this?
6192355000146885 He has a strange sense of humor.
6192355000146886 Take these rags back to the Theatre and go home.
6192355000146883 Volunteers. Orderlies. He made us put on these clothes and come to him.
6192355000146888 Well, aren't you a bunch of gullible fellows.
6192355000146889 Good that you're taking hygiene so seriously.
6192355000146890 Flea protection? This town hasn't had fleas in twenty years.
6192355000146887 Flea protection. He said we'd thank him soon. And we believe him.
6192355000447055 Orderly
6192355001374455 
6192355000153099 你是谁?
6192355000858303 I know you.
6192355000153098 What an interesting place.
6192355000858305 Why are you here then?
6192355000858311 Same. Nice to meet you.
6192355000858304 A genius.
6192355000858307 So you want to know the future?
6192355000858308 What exactly are you planning on asking her?
6192355000881351 An extinct creature, now. What were you planning on asking?
6192355000858306 I wonder what sort of creature this 艾斯佩蒂 is. Perhaps she can tell my fortune… As it is, I'm somewhat depressed.
6192355000858313 Curious about what?
6192355000858316 All right. See you.
6192355000858312 No. I know what the future holds for me. I'm simply curious.
6192355000858315 The Tower… You mean the one that grew in the Stone Yard?
6192355000858321 Who is Farkhad?
6192355000858314 I wonder how long my tower will hold. I wonder if Farkhad forgave me… if Brother is angry with me… I wonder about many things.
6192355000858318 It's… impressive.
6192355000858319 It scares me.
6192355000858320 I do.
6192355000858317 "Grew"? It isn't a weed. We built it. Or don't you like it?
6192355000858323 Ah! I see.
6192355000858324 I remember his grave in the Cemetery. The one with the eye.
6192355000858322 A talented corpse. A capable architect, though far below my league. He built the Cathedral.
6192355000858326 I see.
6192355000858327 So that's why you drink, huh? An uneasy conscience is a heavy burden.
6192355000858325 My brother and I built it. Killed him ourselves, buried him ourselves.
6192355000717277 There's wickedness in my eyes. 
6192355000717278 I don't drink.
6192355000717279 All right.
6192355000717276 There's a gleam of goodness in your eyes, my friend. Drink with me.
6192355000717281 What about hearing?
6192355000717291 Twyrine doesn't heighten hearing. It just dampens all the other senses.
6192355000717280 Everyone says twyrine heightens the senses, but I think that's only true of hearing. Vision—no, you won't see anything new. It isn't absinthe. No smells, either. This place reeks of herbs as it is. Hearing, though…
6192355000717283 There's no such thing as bad twyrine.
6192355000717284 Twyrine's a dangerous liquor. Who knows where it might lure you.
6192355000717282 Just drink, and you'll hear how the Town sounds. You'll hear who's calling you, and from where. You'll hear a murmur from afar… Perhaps from across the Gorkhon. Or perhaps from across the Styx itself… \nDrink to my health, friend. This is excellent twyrine.
6192355000717286 So what do you do?
6192355000717287 You don't exactly look rich.
6192355000717285 I can afford this kind of joy.
6192355000717289 Thanks for the drink, friend.
6192355000717290 Likewise. Only I used to be a doctor.
6192355000717288 I was once an architect. Now I'm just a… shadow of an architect.
6192355000717293 And I'm 阿泰米 布拉克. Let's drink to my 父亲's memory. A good man.
6192355000717294 I think you've had enough, Peter.
6192355000717292 My name is Peter. I am the rock upon which is built the stairway to tomorrow. To the day when man lifts himself from the earth and overcomes its burden. \nI am that rock. And I have already built the first step of that stairway. For I am a true architect.
6192355000717296 I'll check.
6192355000717297 Thank you for the valuable gift. I'll return the favor if I get a chance.
6192355000717295 Drink, 布拉克, drink your twyrine. Listen to the world. Listen to the roar of the terrible earth. Listen to the ringing of the sky. Listen to the Town opening for you. \nYou'll find out where people wait for you. Or whispering about you right now. It's been proven to work.
6192355000734076 Leave whom behind?
6192355000734077 The Judge wanted me to check on you.
6192355000734075 I should have left this god-forsaken place two years ago. Get clean and move away for good. But I have no spine. I'm not a real man. Cannot leave her behind.
6192355000904452 So it was you who thought up that thing? 彼得 斯塔马丁…
6192355000904453 You stink of booze, and your hands are shaking. You drink a lot, don't you?
6192355000904451 The Tower, my precious Tower… The locals call her "the Polyhedron", referring to her as "it," as if she were inanimate. But for me, she is alive and female, and I can't abandon her. \nI have to gaze upon her again and again… to convince myself she exists.
6192355000904455 What are you talking about?
6192355000904454 The Judge? What does he want with me? I will never build another one… No one ever will.
6192355000904457 为什么？
6192355000904465 So, it was you who designed that… thing on the opposite bank?
6192355000904456 A lot. I have to quit drinking, but I don't have any willpower left.
6192355000904459 As you wish.
6192355000904458 There must be a reason, don't you think? But you're a doctor, not a priest. My memory is faulty, true, but I don't remember us being friends. \nTell me, 你想要什么？ I'm not looking for company.
6192355000904461 Such things are never coincidences.
6192355000904464 How does it stand?
6192355000917810 Your brother disagrees.
6192355000904460 I am considered responsible for her creation… but I'm not God to completely defy gravity. It's… happenstance. Such a tower shouldn't be. It breaks the laws of physics. Laws of optics as well. Just a coincidence.
6192355000904463 阿泰米 布拉克.
6192355000904469 Usually people call me "Help, I'm dying!"
6192355000904471 Doesn't matter.
6192355001601540 We've met already! Have you drunk yourself amnesiac?
6192355000904462 Listen, what's your name?
6192355000904467 This is an interesting chat, architect. We should talk more later.
6192355000904468 Whatever. This is not why I am here.
6192355000904466 That's what I'm pondering right now: How does she stand, indeed? Like a rose on its stem…
6192355000904473 Prophylaxis. You're in a plagued district.
6192355000904474 To give you something better than twyrine.
6192355000904475 Just wanted to meet you.
6192355000904472 Why have you come?
6192355000904477 A mysophobic circus artist? Now that's something.
6192355000904478 I'll check on her. It's my job.
6192355000904479 That girl? "Interesting" is an understatement. Her nerves sure could use treatment.
6192355000904476 Listen, doctor… You should check on 安娜, too. She's a circus artist who lives nearby. She's mysophobic—I'm worried she might lose it completely, these days. She's an interesting one. Be a pity if she died or went nuts.
6192355000917812 Your brother is alive and well.
6192355000917813 He is… a keen one.
6192355000917811 Ah… You spoke to him, didn't you? How is he? Why even ask, though… My brother is a tough man. He can overcome any hardship.
6192355000917815 I can. I can do everything.
6192355000917816 I specialize in another field.
6192355000917814 All of us could use some treatment in that regard. Can you do that?
6192355000772154 What do you mean?
6192355001439776 Put the bottle down, Peter. You've had enough.
6192355000772153 You know, old boy, I was never persecuted for my genius. Nor was I prosecuted for murder. And yet, it turns out <i>all this</i> was my hell after all.
6192355001427268 Whom?
6192355001439777 You really don't. She's asleep.
6192355001427267 Hmm… I must go out. I must see her.
6192355001427270 You won't see it. It's no longer there.
6192355001427271 All right. Go.
6192355001427269 My tower.
6192355001427273 The 凯恩s want to build a new town across the Gorkhon. You should go with them.
6192355001439778 You've had enough, pal. And miracles don't exist. You don't see that? They're incompatible with life.
6192355001427272 You're a cruel man, 布拉克. Can't you see I'm mad? Would it be so difficult to play along for a bit? Then I could believe in a miracle… for a few minutes longer.
6192355001427275 You'll build a new one. The 凯恩s will support you.
6192355001427274 You're a kind man, doctor. She's no longer there. And yet here you are… playing along… as if I'm a child. Tell me… How is she?
6192355001427277 So then you did see eye to eye…
6192355001427278 And so you gave up?
6192355001427276 We didn't see eye to eye, the Judge and I. He argued that the Tower was never their family's crowning achievement… merely mine. And I concur. It was my crown. I've hit the ceiling…
6192355001427280 Because there won't be any more twyrine to drink.
6192355001427281 It's the price we paid for curbing the outbreak.
6192355001427279 Yes… We shared the same opinion. Where's the inspiration in that? Consensus is an anchor…\nSay, 布拉克. Why do they say miracles have abandoned the steppe?
6192355001427283 Yes, Peter. Your tower vanished along with our miracles.
6192355001427286 There are no miracles, Peter.
6192355001428751 It's all in the past now. The choice has been made. No point in regrets.
6192355001427282 So my glass miracle vanished alongside your steppe miracles… You know, 布拉克? Don't say anything. Let it be so.
6192355001599589 Anything untouched by infected hands!
6192355001513073 Little girls? I'm not sure. Raspberries and earthworms, I believe, although you need to chew them yourself first.
6192355001409253 How's she doing here?
6192355001141176 See? I've got a second daughter now. The first one is over there, by the Gorkhon… and the second is here, by my side.\nUmm… Any idea what they eat?
6192355001409255 Let me guess… to quit the booze?
6192355001513079 To feed her normally?
6192355001513080 To give her a separate room?
6192355001409254 She gave me a brilliant idea.
6192355001513065 No, I don't. I'm not a psalm person.
6192355001513066 Why are you reciting psalms?
6192355001513072 Perhaps there is a reason.
6192355001513064 "Thou shalt not fear the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;\nNor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday."\nRemember the psalm? I've always been curious why the pestilence "walks" there. Like it's a living creature…
6192355001513068 Oh, it shall, whether you pray or not.
6192355001513069 Stop fretting. It won't touch you. You drink like a fish, and liquid courage offers good protection…
6192355001599588 It already has come. It's too late for psalms now.
6192355001513067 Well, it's supposed to be a protective chant. From pestilence… and also, "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."
6192355001513071 For who?
6192355001513070 I'm not praying for myself, blockhead. It's for her.
6192355001513075 No, you idiot! Bread, meat, milk, vegetables! Whatever you have…
6192355001513078 Sure.
6192355001513074 Really…?
6192355001513082 Peter… Get some sleep.
6192355001513083 That's… uh… genius?
6192355001513084 Pits are frowned upon around here, don't you know? Even regular ones.
6192355001513081 No! \nWhy do we keep insisting that buildings have to go upwards? I want to create a Great Pit, 布拉克! Get it? Like a Polyhedron, but <i>down,</i> not up!
6192355001513086 I don't.
6192355001513087 Peter. You need to get some sleep. I mean it. Tomorrow, when your head is clearer, you'll draw that pit of yours.
6192355001513088 You've just invented humanity's mass grave. Is that it?
6192355001513085 Wait! The Polyhedron defied the law of gravity—so the Pit would completely defy our perception of space! Our understanding of up and down! Do you get it? Do you?
6192355001513090 So that's how you and 格蕾丝 connected…
6192355001513091 Peter, I'll take her from you in a couple of days. Got it?
6192355001513092 Have some sleep. You'll dream of that pit of yours.
6192355001513089 A pit! A genius pit…
6192355001508152 …He said, from the far room.
6192355001514055 Whoa. "Your" 格蕾丝? 父亲ly instincts kicking in?
6192355001514060 Like you have a choice… You two belong together now. Try to take care of each other.
6192355001508151 Don't even try. I'm not leaving. What do I need to do, give her poultices? Then hand them over.\nI won't leave the girl, and I won't let you take her. My 格蕾丝…
6192355001514064 So you <i>do</i> know what water is?
6192355001514065 It's because she's a child.
6192355001592006 Protect her.
6192355001514063 She's like a gulp of fresh water, old boy. She sings lullabies to my paintings. Lullabies! They're alive to her. Or dead… but they're people. People! Do you understand? \nI can almost stand looking at them without nausea now, too…
6192355001514080 Who knew you'd turn out to be so loyal.
6192355001592005 The liquid kind?
6192355001514079 Don't you shame me! I'm afraid, yes. Afraid of looking at her, at that rotten rag instead of a face. Afraid of how she's wheezing. Standing there stock-still. Why do they always stand? She won't sit or lie down…\nBut don't you dare assume. I'll do… whatever it is I need to do. Just let me find my courage…
6192355000794357 彼得·斯塔马丁
6192355001258465 彼得·斯塔马丁
6192355001262557 Seriously. Say, kid, do you know who, or what, an "udurgh" is?
6192355001262556 Very much so. If I wasn't alive, who would be superior to everyone else here, I wonder?
6192355000302053 Well, you have ears like a mouse.
6192355000302054 And not just shingles.
6192355000302055 You're 塔雅·泰吉.
6192355000302052 Ene she yuun khun gheeshebshe? You have ears like a jerboa. Did you know you can catch shingles from a jerboa? Just like that.
6192355000302057 Are you all fine? I mean, are you healthy?
6192355000302062 How come?
6192355001262754 Ime beshe, it is not.
6192355000302056 My entire family is right here. And I'll have you know it's your family, too.
6192355000302059 Where's your 父亲? Overseer 泰吉?
6192355000302067 What would you like to be brought, girl?
6192355001257948 Screaming through the walls? 为什么？
6192355000302058 Myy uymen… I hate it here. They tell me all day long that I'm the most important person, yet they won't let me out. Won't let me play. Won't bring me anything I ask for.\nAnd they keep screaming and screaming through the walls! Who would want to live in such a place?
6192355000302061 It's good that they're not letting you out. It's safer that way.
6192355000302068 I thought it was I who dreamed of you.
6192355000302060 How can I know that if they won't even let me out of this room? It's so, <i>so</i> boooring!\nAt least you got here, that's <i>something</i> new. And even that is only because I'm dreaming of you. Bou khara, bou shagna…
6192355001257947 That's fine, I'll live…
6192355000302064 But where's your dad?
6192355000302070 Where's 弗尔曼·傲云? Is he here with you?
6192355000302063 Because we are the Kin. We are of the same blood. Of the same root. All children of Boddho, toonto nutag, aba ezhe… something something… That's what Dad says.\nAnd you've got a scratch on your cheek!
6192355000302066 I just wanted to make sure you're alive.
6192355000302069 Do you know who, or what, an "udurgh" is?
6192355000302065 She yuunde ereebshe? Why did you come, anyway? You must have some sort of request for Our Not-So-Highness. I'm listening.
6192355000302075 Yeah, can't imagine any complications with that.
6192355000302077 Thanks, kid.
6192355000302074 Follow the road by which bulls come to us from the steppe.\nMedeneghshe, now <i>that</i> was a great place to live. I'd like it sooo much to leave these ugly walls and move there. Life would become incredible. And it's so easy…
6192355001221252 I'll be sure to let him know.
6192355001262760 A wish… Well, I only have one…
6192355001221251 Don't go there now. Today, he's not listening. Go tomorrow, after you wake.\nFind the Ear, whisper in it, and it'll grant you a wish. And please let him know I hate it here and can't wait to leave! I've had enough of this place, tiimel daa…
6192355001221254 I'll be sure to let him know.
6192355001262759 A wish… Well, I only have one…
6192355001221253 Go there as soon as you wake. Find the Ear, whisper in it, and it'll grant you a wish. And please let him know I hate it here and can't wait to leave! I've had enough of this place, tiimel daa…
6192355001221256 I will. You take care of yourself.
6192355001262761 Be kharanab, you're a smart girl. Stay here for now. Wait some more.
6192355001262762 Bayartay, Your Superiorness. See you.
6192355001221255 And do come back here sometime.
6192355001257950 Well, it's good you're safe in here. But I guess your people are unhappy? They want to go outside?
6192355001257949 I guess they're bored, too. I'd also like to scream, but I don't! I want to, but I'm silent. I want to cry, yet I laugh. I'm inside-out girl!
6192355001262752 Yes, Your Highness.
6192355001262753 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai! That's one smart girl!
6192355001262758 You're surprisingly eloquent. As though you grew up in the Town.
6192355001262751 You are to call me like they did on the outside: Mother Superior. That's 'cause I'm better than everyone.
6192355001262756 Don't think I can manage that. This town's never seen any strawberries or raspberries.
6192355001262757 Never eaten those. I've only seen them in books.
6192355001262755 Strawberry… It's a nice white berry. I saw it when I was in the Tower. It smells so yummy!\nAnd raspberry. It can also be red or white, but in truth, it's yellow. Yamar goe bee, so pretty! So tasty!
6192355001411616 What tale?
6192355001411619 What riddle?
6192355001411615 I know the word. It's from a tale! Or a riddle, maybe…
6192355001411618 How do I get there?
6192355001411620 The old village? But it's been dead for so long… 
6192355001411617 "The udurgh has a special mound, his ear sticking from the ground. Just make a wish and grab the mud until your hands are filled with blood."\nIt's about the old village! So I guess the udurgh is there… 
6192355000520272 Feet… Feet are fine. What about the rest of you?
6192355000520273 The important thing is, you're alive, girl from 父亲's list.
6192355000525067 Have we met before?
6192355000520271 My feet ache.
6192355000520275 Just don't be scared when you walk out of this room. Don't look around, and think happy thoughts.
6192355000525102 It's… not really. It's dangerous. To be honest, it's bad.
6192355000520274 No. They won't let me out. Even though I'm… I'm superior, and they must listen! But no one does…\nNot enough toys here. Very boring. Is the outside more interesting?
6192355000525069 Is that why your feet ache? Were you stomping around a lot?
6192355000525074 Like anyone would listen to me here.
6192355000525068 No, we haven't.\nThey won't let anyone in to see me! Tell them to let guests in! Or I'll get angry again, like I did yesterday!
6192355000525071 No… I don't have anything nice.
6192355000525070 Also gums and guts, because I chewed on resin. And… because they won't give me anything tasty anymore. Did you bring anything nice?
6192355000525073 Tell me, kid… Did you ever leave this room? Do you know what's happening outside?
6192355000525099 I came to get you.
6192355000525072 So what kind of human are you? Why did you come?
6192355000525080 Why go to Shekhen? It's deserted.
6192355001484069 That place is abandoned and uninhabitable.
6192355000525079 Where will we go? Shekhen, yes? Tell me it's Shekhen! Be khara, what a great idea!
6192355000525082 We don't need too much space. I'll take you in.
6192355001484070 It won't work. They'll let you out of this stone tomb, but not the Town… due to the quarantine.
6192355000525081 It's spacious. We'll all find a place there.
6192355000525084 No. You alone.
6192355000525083 And the rest of us, too?
6192355000525091 Well, can you count? How many fingers am I showing to you now?
6192355000525090 "Hello-ne"? What do you mean? I don't understand the word.
6192355000525095 No, there's one.
6192355000525094 Ten.
6192355000525097 What a stubborn kid. Fine. I'll figure something out.
6192355000525098 One tiny kid speaking for all those people… Now I understand what 父亲 meant.
6192355001484077 Lesson one… 傲云 was right. I don't understand you anymore.
6192355000525096 Yes, it does! It's the same! How can you separate me from Khatanghe, nunehen zaila? You don't cut fingers from a hand! What a stupid idea, <i>helloning</i> someone! Ime beshe, we'll only leave together. \nThen we'll live together. Here, we won't live. It'll be great, yamar goe be!
6192355000525101 Yes. We'll go outside now. Will you come?
6192355000525100 Me?
6192355000525104 I have my ups and downs…
6192355000525103 But I'm brave! Aren't you?
6192355001484072 I don't think I can. But I can get <i>you</i> out.
6192355001484071 Then take that qua-rat-thing away!
6192355001484076 That's not how it works…
6192355001484075 No, there's ten! You've got ten fingers on your hands.
6192355000772224 Preaching already, girl?
6192355001440080 Hey, are you all right up there, dyy basaghan? Are your feet not cold?
6192355000772223 Medenegshe, I hereby grant you new law. \nOver your left hand it is done, not the right. So speaks Mother Boddho… Unsure <i>why</i> she speaks so, but still. We will tell hands apart, now. Tiimel daa.
6192355001440072 Fair enough.
6192355001440085 Tiimel daa.
6192355001440086 You're a harsh ruler…
6192355001440071 So, medenegshe, here's another law for you.\nNever hold a grudge, for grudges are bad for health and sneak behind. Be khara, whoever carries a grudge, shall slip on it and break their neck. So speaks Suok; she'll see to it at night. Tiimel daa, let it be so.
6192355001440074 Those are some good laws, kid…
6192355001440084 Yamar berkhe basaghan dai!
6192355001440073 Medenegshe, heed our law.\nNever deceive or betray the small ones and the ones that trust you. It is not only Suok's nocturnal law; Mother Boddho would turn away from you, too. No harming the small ones, tiimel daa. Let it be so.
6192355001440076 I think that's enough law for one day. You've done a great job, kid.
6192355001440079 Well done! Spoken like a true Mother Superior! Tiimel daa.
6192355001440075 Medenegshe, now for the most important law. The law of candy, sweets, and those soft white thingies they sell in shops. They are to be abundant. No one has the right to forbid eating them.\nMother Boddho… Somehow she will not see to this law. So I'll have to do it myself. Tiimel daa… Oh, I wonder what I should invent next?
6192355001440078 I just… wanted to take a look at you.
6192355001440089 Hara bosooli, it didn't take you long to fit into your new role…
6192355001440077 Why are you here? She yuunded ereebshe? Did you come to listen to our not-so-highness?
6192355001440082 I just…
6192355001440083 I humbly obey, Mother Superior.
6192355001440081 Nope! Ene shi yuun khun gheeshebshe. Please don't interrupt!
6192355001440088 All right, go on.
6192355001440087 How am I harsh? Those aren't even my words, baygalday!
6192355001363093 How about "Mistress of the Kin," instead?
6192355001438875 You mean… these new ones?
6192355001363092 I'll be the Mistress of Bulls.
6192355001438871 Well, I was just looking for someone to help me. You're the one everyone will listen to, after all.
6192355001438872 Not a Mistress, I'm afraid.
6192355001438870 Beshe, beshe… And who will you be?
6192355001438874 What about the Kin, though?
6192355001438879 That'll do, huh? Thanks, kiddo! Glad I meet your high standards.
6192355001438873 Be khara, you are a good man. You've got funny ears, but that's all right. That'll do. And I'll be the Mistress of Bulls.
6192355001438877 Leave bulls to butchers and odonghe. It's their job.
6192355001438878 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai!
6192355001438876 Them, too. But they will go, and ours will stay.
6192355001438881 There are people in it, too.
6192355001438880 The Kin <i>are</i> the bulls.
6192355001438883 Oh, yeah. I will have to now, some day.
6192355001438884 That was… to be expected. And appropriate…
6192355001438885 Be khara, you'll make a great Mistress. Bayartay, kiddo.
6192355001438882 Nuh uh. More bulls than people now. Much less human than before. It's so awesome now! Come and see for yourself. Will you come?
6192355001492447 No. But I'll come to visit.
6192355001515853 Do share! I'd sell my soul for sweet talh…
6192355001515854 Living with you? That's a bold proposal…
6192355001492446 You know what? The Khatanghe are baking me oatmeal talh. I demanded it sweet! I'll share with you too, if you come to live with us.
6192355001497552 You're the prettiest here, anyway.
6192355001515855 That'll make you a true Mother Superior.
6192355001497551 Also, the Khatanghe are making me a necklace from chuulu and berry stones. Davuu erh, only I am allowed to wear that!
6192355001497555 Wow! So where will your Not-So-Highness reside?
6192355001515857 You're keeping everyone busy, then. Good job.
6192355001497554 Also, the Khatanghe are stuffing pillows for me! I want a pillow takh! And they're carving a wooden step, so I could sit higher than anyone, softer than anyone, and prettier than anyone! Tiimel daa!
6192355001515852 Teasing me, Mother?
6192355001515858 Like I could compare to you!
6192355001515859 You have so many ideas… I can tell you're a serious person from a mile away.
6192355001515851 The Khatanghe are making me a personal yurt, all mine! It'll be all colorful, with a shanyrak on top. Yag iim baina! All Shekhen will see me!\nAnd you know what? You don't have the same!
6192355001499068  
6192355001499067  
6192355001513867 Yamar yuumen toukhai? What kind of tale would you like?
6192355001513868 If I can remember any...
6192355001513869 No. No tales today. Stay quiet, I'll bring you a cure.
6192355001513866 Ontokho khelekhe. Tell me a tale. It'll hurt less if you do.
6192355001513871 It's a sad tale. Thank heavens it's just a tale.
6192355001516163 Is there really such a tale?
6192355001513870 Tell me a scary one. The one where we stayed in that house of stone and died.
6192355001516152 It's a beautiful tale. But I don't know it…
6192355001513873 Well… there once was a girl… Shudkher! I can't, little one. I'm no good at inventing such tales…
6192355001513872 Tell me how we all could have lived in Shekhen…
6192355001513875 Yamar yuumen toukhai? What kind of tale would you like?
6192355001513874 Then stay with me a bit here, ontokho khelekhe. Tell me a tale. It'll ease my pain a bit if you do… Be naydamtay bolokho…
6192355001515452 Fine. What kind of tale do you want to hear?
6192355001515451 Unacceptable! I'm saying this as a Mother Superior! Ontokho khelekhe.
6192355001516157 I'll cure you, little one. I swear…
6192355001526313 Come now… Yamar berkhe basaghan bai, you're doing great, girl! Just bear it a little more.
6192355001516153 And my throat hurts, too… Ankhadaghaa aman boloshohon… Do you have a pill that makes it less painful to swallow?
6192355001516160 I don't remember either…
6192355001518552 It will go well. Everything in little 塔雅's life will go well. I promise.
6192355001516159 I don't remember how it goes… It hurts. How does it go?
6192355001518555  
6192355001518557  
6192355001518558  
6192355001518554  
6192355001518560 Hush, little one. Be patient, like the brave girl you are.
6192355001518562 You're not going anywhere, dүү basaghan. I won't let you.
6192355001518559 You know what my fingers tell me? "Come, we need you, Mother." I've been here for a long time. If they call for me, I'll go! 'Cause they're calling. I'm Mother, I need to care for them… Khyygedi be oshokho.
6192355001518567 Here. Folded.
6192355001518568 I don't know this song…
6192355001518566 <i>Barbaaday, I've found a bull…</i> Come on, you need to fold your fingers as I speak! Fold your thumb.
6192355001526305 It's me, kid…
6192355001526304 Khembe? Who is it? Who's there? Take this nasty cloth off of me, someone…
6192355001526311 What do your fingers say?
6192355001526312 Do your fingers hurt?
6192355001526310 Emshen! You're not curing me, and my fingers… It hurts, khurganuudni untarna. It hurts!

6192355000653052 What's up there in the Tower?
6192355000653053 卡斯帕·凯恩? So you're the one they call 可汗? I've been looking for you.
6192355000653054 Wrong. They apply to everyone. Leaders most of all.
6192355000653051 Yes, yes, I know. We're supposed to stay indoors. And the Tower's inhabitants do just that, I make sure my people follow the law. But I am 卡斯帕·凯恩; your laws don't apply to me.
6192355000653056 Why are <i>you</i> here, then?
6192355000653061 Do they really obey? 你是谁 to disallow anything?
6192355000653055 The Tower is home to youth. Almost three hundred people inside. All safe. Like I said, I observe the quarantine. They're not allowed to leave.
6192355000653058 If you get sick, you'll bring the infection back in there with you. What were you thinking?
6192355000653069 A brave lad, are you… So, why are you here?
6192355000653057 Who else is to risk their life but me?
6192355000653060 What makes you think you'll notice immediately?
6192355001151697 Sounds serious.
6192355000653059 Do you take me for an idiot, or a negligent bastard? Those are my people. I'm responsible for them. If I get sick, I won't ever return, <i>obviously.</i>
6192355000653063 你认识我父亲，伊西多·布拉克。你和他. 你和他有什么来往？
6192355000653079 你知道我是谁吗？
6192355000653062 我是可汗。维克多·凯恩之子。
6192355000653065 西蒙?
6192355000653074 我明白了。那你和诺克金呢？
6192355000653064 We talked. I was curious what 西蒙 saw in him.
6192355000653068 I'm a local. And I know about 西蒙. Mind your manners.
6192355001151690 It's not like he created all that on his own.
6192355001151693 I'm sorry about your loss, 卡斯帕.
6192355000653066 Excuse me, were you born yesterday? 西蒙 凯恩. The head of our family. My uncle. The immortal man. The one who died two days ago. The one we can't live without. \nHe molded this town into what it is. He kept its spirit aflame. Do you honestly have no idea who he was?
6192355000653071 你们俩是朋友？
6192355001151698 "Negotiate." A big word.
6192355000653070 To negotiate with 诺克金 over there. Any more questions?
6192355000653073 No, I'm not done yet. Do you know how my 父亲 died?
6192355001151700 Since you came here anyway, at least stay here, all right? Indoors.
6192355000653072 We're enemies, after a fashion. His Soul-and-a-Halves against my Dogheads. But we're negotiating an armistice now. If he lets go of his usual bullheadedness, it might happen.\nAre you happy now? Can we get back to our business?
6192355000653076 No. But we got to know each other, in a way. What are you up to?
6192355001151696 You're in an odd place at an odd time. I suspect you're up to no good.
6192355000653075 Why do you ask? It's not like he's your son.
6192355000653078 What are you two up to?
6192355000653077 You're a doctor. I respect your future heroism. So I am offering you an overabundance of politesse.
6192355000653081 Check what?
6192355000653083 …Fine. I can tell you're not lying.
6192355000653080 No. Not yet. I have a hypothesis… but it's too early to tell. I'll have to check.
6192355000653085 But I do believe you. Now, I do. And I'm coming with you.
6192355000653086 You're way too strict for your age, kids… Perhaps your friend over there has more time. I mean. Your enemy.
6192355000653084 No. I think you're too old to believe in fairy tales. A skeptic would only get in the way. So I won't even waste time explaining.
6192355000794353 I hate overconfident, bullheaded people!
6192355001151699 What are you doing in this pub?
6192355000794351 I'll figure it out.
6192355001151692 You don't look like enemies.
6192355001151691 No two people in the world had more differences than your 父亲 and 西蒙. They couldn't agree on anything, but got very close. Even though they should've been rivals—maybe even enemies. Like 诺克金 and I.
6192355001151695 I do care.
6192355001151701 I care about everything these days. Such is a doctor's job in the days of an outbreak.
6192355001151694 Excuse me, but why in the world should you care? I don't understand why you find it appropriate to pry into our affairs.
6192355001151731 Will you take me with you?
6192355001151732 Elaborate.
6192355001151730 The hypothesis. The theory. The idea. Was I not sufficiently clear? It needs testing.\nIf 诺克金 stops playing the fool and sends his Soul-and-a-Halves to search, maybe we can even do it tonight.
6192355000772491 Sure.
6192355001439259 No. I didn't talk to you as much as I should have.
6192355000772490 Let us be quiet for a while.
6192355001439252 But we do have common ground.
6192355001439253 I'm sorry about your Tower, 卡斯帕.
6192355001443008 I can see the two of you are sharing a moment. I will be on my way.
6192355001439251 You're always so untimely… with all due respect, doctor.
6192355001439256 What do you plan to do now?
6192355001443009 It's up to you to be worthy of respect.
6192355001439255 I had utmost respect for your 父亲, Master 布拉克. We weren't friends, and neither will I be your friend. But respect is possible. It's up to us.
6192355001439262 Tough.
6192355001439266 So she's in charge? Somehow, I'm not surprised.
6192355001439261 卡佩拉 plans, not me. We'll do everything together from now on. Ask her.
6192355001439264 I'm sorry, kid. I really am.
6192355001439265 I guess you'll have to find a new venture, then. But you 凯恩s appreciate self-development, don't you?
6192355001439263 Not what I dreamt of doing.
6192355001592759 The "Rose"?
6192355001467056 The Bridge Square is infected! And yet you cross it on foot…
6192355001517654 You were so worried about safety… but now you're back. Changed your mind?
6192355001467055 Don't worry about us. Not many children are here so far, but more are coming—everyone who's healthy.\nThe Rose will protect us from the plague.
6192355001467058 What if there's a bombardment? Have you seen the cannon they've brought in…?
6192355001467059 Let me through. I want to talk to the others.
6192355001467057 There's infection below. That's why we're standing here waiting. The signs appear quickly. That's what the 学者 told me.\nThis staircase is the best isolation ward available. We'll spend the night here. The sick will descend. Whoever remains on the staircase by the morning will go inside.
6192355001467061 Yeah, you're right.
6192355001467062 Tell them I love them, too. And I do know why.
6192355001467060 Don't. For whatever reason, they love you. Send you all the hellos in the world.\nYou—don't breathe on them. You're the one who came from the square. Go back down. And don't return until this is all over.
6192355001517656 You do look healthy.
6192355001517657 Unless you've contracted the infection on your way here.
6192355001517655 丹考夫斯基 said I was healthy.
6192355001592761 Like hell it'll protect you if you keep running across infected districts.
6192355001594756 You were so worried about safety… but now you're back. Changed your mind?
6192355001592760 The Polyhedron. The Tower. The Wind Rose.
6192355001594754 True… now let me talk to the others.
6192355001594755 Mature reasoning.
6192355001594753 If there is a bombardment, we're all doomed anyway.
6192355001499056 You're not a stranger to me, you know.
6192355001499055 Ah, 布拉克. You are the only doctor who comes as he pleases, before a patient calls.
6192355001517564 We connected well enough in the House of Death.
6192355001517565 Are you unhappy I failed to get along with your sister?
6192355001517566 I was hoping that magic lantern over there would warm you a bit. I fixed it, you know.
6192355001517575 I regret it too. Although, our 父亲s managed it. Perhaps we also had a chance… Who knows.
6192355001517563 But I am. We've failed to connect, I'm afraid, and it doesn't look like we'll get a chance. I may even regret it somewhat.
6192355001517568 Perhaps you'll understand someday.
6192355001517579 You and 诺克金 did everything yourselves. Now how do you plan to survive?
6192355001517567 I understand we're only adolescent kids. Hot-headed, maybe. But I still can't understand your reasons. I never would have done what you did.
6192355001517570 Fair enough. Although, I'd like to ask you a thing or two about 西蒙 someday…
6192355001517580 As you wish.
6192355001517569 I will not discuss my family with you.
6192355001517572 The words of a young leader…
6192355001517571 Thank you. Now fix the infected people—someone, anyone. I'm not asking for myself, but for my friends.
6192355001517577 Ah, the 凯恩s…
6192355001517578 I'll try.
6192355001517576 Well, if we stop chatting and you try to do something, there is a chance it might happen. In theory.
6192355001526315 Me.
6192355001526316 Who did you expect? The angel of death?
6192355001526314 Who's this?
6192355001526319 She is. For now.
6192355001526320 I'm sorry. No.
6192355001526321 卡佩拉 is the soul of this town. She'll live forever as such. That's her true existence.
6192355001526318 Just tell me, and don't ask idle questions about <i>relationships!</i> Is 卡佩拉 alive?
6192355001499769 You must be confused. We're not in the Polyhedron.
6192355001517651 Aren't you the kid I first met in a twyrine den?
6192355001499768 Why must you always intrude upon children? You don't belong here.
6192355001507854 See that lantern over there? I fixed that. I've earned the right to be here.
6192355001507855 Wrong. Children have many places of their own. Me, 斯塔克, 格里夫, and 格拉薇尔 would sometimes vanish for weeks…
6192355001507856 Are you talking about your own family?
6192355001507853 We have so few places of our own—only a couple. And yet you feel the urge to impose yourself even here.\nDo you know what childhood is? It's slavery. Herders treat their cattle better than parents treat their children. They lock us up like objects, mold us like statues, and still never take us remotely seriously.
6192355001507858 What happened to you? Why are you here and not in the Tower?
6192355001507857 Whatever you say.
6192355001507860 You're a responsible young man.
6192355001507861 So what happened to you, son of a ruler?
6192355001507859 Of course not. I am a ruler之子. To me, my own issues must always be of least concern. But I'm not blind. I see the others.
6192355001507863 Me?
6192355001507866 Would you look at that… I'm once again the culprit.
6192355001507862 …You happened to me.
6192355001507865 Damn it! All right, let me see your pupils. And be honest with me… Are you infected?
6192355001507867 As if you wouldn't have gone without me, anyway! At least I supervised.
6192355001517652 So it was <i>me</i> who goaded <i>you</i> into it? Are you shameless enough to say that with a straight face?
6192355001507864 I'm not shifting responsibility onto you. And I have no regrets. Going to that house was the right thing to do—I've heard it even helped slow the infection somewhat…\nHowever, in your place, I'd never allow two adolescents to venture inside a hotbed of infection.
6192355001507871 Is that so?
6192355001517653 That's a very mature line of thinking.
6192355001507870 I don't know anything for certain anymore. How long is its incubation period? No one knows. That means I can't go back to the Polyhedron.
6192355001507873 And here I thought it was magic, that Polyhedron of yours.
6192355001507874 I can examine you. Face the light and open your eyes wider…
6192355001507875 If you're sick, we'll find you some shmowder.
6192355001507877 I have medicine. A true cure for sand pest. Very little of it, but…
6192355001507872 Several hundred of my friends live there. I'm their leader. If there is even a miniscule chance that I've contracted sand pest…\nNo. I'm not even approaching the Tower unless I know for sure.
6192355001507879 You're like a 父亲 to your 士兵s, aren't you?
6192355001507902 Don't worry. If you're sick, I'll find a way…
6192355001507878 Surely you jest? Of course it's magic. Wondrous. Inexplicable. But the people inside… they're just people, made of flesh and bone.
6192355001507890 
6192355001507889 
6192355001507894 But here, inside the Town, is exactly where you're in the most danger!
6192355001507895 Fair enough. Perhaps you'll make peace with 诺克金, after all.
6192355001507893 You're a doctor. I'll accept your help if you decide it's required. To do otherwise would be pointless arrogance.\nBut this plague is like a wild cat. Today it hides, tomorrow it ambushes. I'd rather stay here for now.
6192355001507899 Forget it. I can tell it's hard for you to be away from that Tower.
6192355001507900 Apology accepted.
6192355001507901 It's I who should apologize. I should have taken better care of you…
6192355001507898 …And I apologize for the way I talked to you earlier.
6192355000794360 可汗
6192355001258460 可汗
6192355001374460 
6192355000270656 What 凯恩? …Who did you expect to find there?
6192355000270657 凯恩? Don't you mean 布拉克?
6192355000271151 I'm sorry.
6192355000198353 My name was Jacob Sterkh. Worked in shipping. Two marriages, both happy. Brought up a daughter. \nFriends woke me up in the night; they were getting a posse together to catch old 凯恩's killer. We ambushed him at the Station. That's where I was killed; with my own knife, no less.
6192355000270659 Take it as a lesson, fool. This world is not for the likes of you.
6192355000270660 I'm sorry.
6192355000270661 It's for the best, Kirik. All of this is for the best…
6192355000270658 I was called Kirik. It was my idea to catch the murderer at the Station. So we lay in ambush. The train came. A man got off. "Get him, boys!" I cried. \nThat was stupid of me. The killer would be getting on, not off…
6192355000270663 That's enough tear-jerking.
6192355000270664 With a name like that, it must've been a tough life. It'll be better now.
6192355000270665 I'm sorry, Bertrand.
6192355000270662 They called me Bertie. Short for "Bertrand." And that's one of the kinder nicknames… "Bertie" was fine. A name's just a name. \nI got murdered at the Station last night. Didn't rightly know what I was doing there. Figure I just went along with the herd.
6192355000341751 Restless One
6192355000198352 Yes. I've read about him.
6192355000270651 But what's my fate?
6192355000270652 Fate is not to be fought, beakhead. It must be overcome another way.
6192355000198351 See? You're a man of fate, 布拉克. What are you trying to prove? You can't change fate. Have you heard the story of Oedipus?
6192355000270654 Nothing wrong with my head. My brain's functioning just fine.
6192355000270655 If I have a hammer, then you might be in trouble, beakhead.
6192355000270683 I'm not a ripper.
6192355000270653 我已经告诉过了，布拉克。It's not pretty. You will spill blood. Just let it go, Ripper. Don't be so bull-headed. Just because you have a hammer doesn't mean every problem's a nail.
6192355000341753 执行者
6192355000270673 If I could only fix it…
6192355000270674 Serves them right. I won't cry over them.
6192355000270672 Did you enjoy your little chats? They don't blame you, as you saw. I suppose they haven't quite come to terms with their fates yet. Or perhaps they have. Death does that to people.
6192355000270676 So?
6192355000270675 I'll tell you a story.\nOnce there was a man who wanted to fix everything. He begged on bended knee for a chance to turn back time… And when he got it, history repeated itself. "Good job," we told him. "That's your fate." He asked us, "Once more?"
6192355000270678 Did he try again, then?
6192355000270679 I do. Shall we try?
6192355000270677 So we let him try once more, but with a catch. He who denies his fate will be punished. He'll keep living as a cripple. Lame. Wounded. See where I'm going with this?
6192355000270681 I'll still try.
6192355000270682 He was permanently crippled? I wonder how…?
6192355000270680 I don't remember and I don't care. Even if he didn't, there probably wasn't a happy ending. You can't fight fate, 布拉克. It's immutable.
6192355000341752 执行者
6192355000212153 Well, we'll see now if I can heal or not.
6192355000212154 I don't need your concern. I can take care of myself.
6192355000212155 Fine. I won't.
6192355000212152 You believe taking your 父亲's vessel was enough to become him? You jest, emshen. You cannot heal. You know not the Lines. \nDon't take too much on, or you'll snap like a rotten bough…
6192355000212157 They're at your place? Very well. Let's pay it a visit, and there I'll take my legacy.
6192355000212158 Whatever. Do as you will.
6192355000212159 I'll try.
6192355000212156 伊西多's notes remain at my place. You're in no hurry to take them, are you? I've heard a thing or two about the Lines, I can replicate the Art. What about you, he-who-casts-off-his-own-legacy? Can you?
6192355000212161 How do you know he will die?
6192355000212162 You're not a doctor, khetey. I am.
6192355000212163 Who the hell are you?
6192355000212160 He will die, emshen. You will take his fate into your hands, and he will die. Stain not your hands with the death of a person who trusts you.
6192355000212165 Then let this be a learning experience for me. Move aside, khetey. I won't hide behind your back.
6192355000212166 Perhaps I'm not so big. But I'm definitely big enough to take responsibility for myself.
6192355000212167 All right. Go on. I'll keep an eye on your progress.
6192355000212164 You are not a healer yet. You will fail. You're a big man, but not so big as to take on responsibility for others…\nBut someone must try it. This is where you are right. We can't simply let it happen without a fight… So let me fight.
6192355000212169 Did you know him well?
6192355000212170 Presumptuous…
6192355000212168 I am 萨巴 Usp'tae. The townsfolk call me 艾斯佩蒂. I am respected, for I can speak on behalf of Earth. I interpret her will. And now I speak to you on behalf of your 父亲.
6192355000212172 But you're not a doctor. How do you know the boy will die?
6192355000212173 Say what you must, and move aside. They're waiting for me.
6192355000212171 I loved him. He made me. I owe him a debt of gratitude.
6192355000337951 艾斯佩蒂
6192355000369251 
6192355000370851 Khatangher
6192355000436952 
6192355000495251 
6192355000331352 Who was that? Who was burned?
6192355000331353 What have you done?!
6192355000331351 Her scream, the poor thing… It must have hurt terribly. Could she… could she have been a person? Clay doesn't scream.
6192355000331355 What wench?
6192355000331356 What old man?
6192355000331357 You're crazy.
6192355000331354 Hell if I know… They think it was the clay wench… The one who killed the old man. \nBut I guess it wasn't… Oh, poor sinners!
6192355000331359 I can't believe my eyes.
6192355000331360 "Welcome home, 阿泰米."
6192355000331358 Go away, go away! It's bad enough as is.
6192355000937852 It wasn't you? Then who?
6192355000937853 Oh yes, I saw your valiant attempts…
6192355000937851 It wasn't us. She was already burning when we came here… We tried to save her, but failed.
6192355000341755 Vigilante
6192355000254352 I just try to follow the Lines.
6192355000254353 Drop it, khetey. I will never compare to him. He was a true weaver.
6192355000254354 He cannot be replaced, but someone has to do his job. So here I am.
6192355000254351 Be khara, you are a true heir to 伊西多. You show it with alacrity, with your deeds. You know the ties that bind the world.
6192355000254356 I did.
6192355000254357 A physician isn't entitled to that.
6192355000254358 Did 父亲 make mistakes, though? I remember no such thing.
6192355000254355 Blame not yourself. "A physician is entitled to some mistakes," as your 父亲 used to say. He erred, too. What matters is that you tried. You had the courage to try. You took upon yourself his role.
6192355000254360 It's heavy…
6192355000254361 Bayarlaa, 萨巴. I gratefully accept.
6192355000254359 This is your 父亲's udhar, his "warm vessel." Inside is your inheritance. Open it.
6192355000254363 No.
6192355000254364 The murderer still breathes. That's what's bothering me.
6192355000254365 I'll think about them.
6192355000254362 Any new thoughts on the contents of the udhar?
6192355001097352 I know the meaning of the word. Why the harsh words, abgai?
6192355001107369 Says who?
6192355001097351 Tenegh. Foolish boy.
6192355001107371 Boleesh, boleesh, bүү alysh… You're right to shame me. This will not happen again. I will learn.
6192355001107372 Maybe my way is different from my 父亲's. It's up to me to decide, khetey!
6192355001107370 Is that how you were taught to heal people? Be khara, you just got lucky. Anyone can administer a remedy someone else made. A child might pick medicine by pretty colors! Be oylgono ugyb, this is not your 父亲's way!
6192355000336351 艾斯佩蒂
6192355000794354 换生灵
6192355000270055 为什么？ Why are they on this list?
6192355000270056 One by one would be better.
6192355000270054 I seek them all, all those on your list. Joyfully: I might take them one by one, I might take them all at once. Shall I follow your whim? Shall I kill them one by one?
6192355000270058 Let the boy go. What use is he to you?
6192355000270059 I'll find a way to beat you. Just you wait. I'm not afraid.
6192355000270057 You have me there, warrior. I relish that you are fearless enough to offer straight answers. One by one it is, then.
6192355000270061 Who is the Eighth?
6192355000270062 Useful how?
6192355000270060 Your 父亲 was wiser than you. Mightier. He knew we did not quarrel over mere menfolk's lives. The goal is the Eighth. The kids matter only as long as they are of use to the Eighth.
6192355000270066 You want to play at riddles? I'd rather be the one asking. Want a tough one?
6192355000270067 So, all the people on the list are useful somehow?
6192355000270065 Guess! Time yet remains for you.
6192355000270069 I don't know.
6192355000270070 You?
6192355000270071 I'll figure it out soon.
6192355000270068 Who slew your 父亲, 布拉克?
6192355000270073 Likewise. You're not here to be played with. You deserve to be hunted down and destroyed.
6192355000270080 At least I know the list of your future victims.
6192355000475551 That's all right. It'll be more fun soon.
6192355000270072 You are a fool, 布拉克. You know nothing. Understand nothing. Call yourself a healer? Don't kid yourself. Who will you heal? From what? Shall you seize an ill babe and cram them full of your "antibiotics"?\nYou're an unbearable bore, no fun at all.
6192355000270075 It walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening. What is it?
6192355000270076 Thieves came to steal the homeowners, but the house itself escapes through the windows.
6192355000270077 How do I kill you?
6192355000270074 Indeed, surprise me.
6192355000270082 I'll figure it out. I'll ask around.
6192355000270083 At least I understand it's not human.
6192355000270081 Moreso the Eighth.
6192355001140972 你想要什么？
6192355001140973 I'm not in the habit of speaking to hallucinations.
6192355001140974 Ugh, this thing again… Maybe I caught the disease from the boy?
6192355001140971 Think you have saved him? You cheat! Only got him a brief break from death.\nIt did not keep me at bay forever. And so I will return to him, again and again, and you shall not have such wild potions with you. Little remains.
6192355000492651 ???
6192355000276338 The Warren? You mean the Termitary?
6192355000276339 Why do you want to get in there?
6192355000276337 Mother Boddho caress your step, yargachin. Have some coin. We've collected it; there's a lot. Tell them to let us into the Warren. We're scared.
6192355000276341 He won't. Go back where you came from.
6192355000276342 I talked to him already. No use.
6192355000276343 All right. Give it to me. I'll try.
6192355000276344 Keep your money.
6192355000276340 Tell them to let us in. Fat 维拉德 will listen to you. Take the money—just tell him yourself!
6192355000276346 Are you hiding from the mob? They calmed down. Relax.
6192355000276347 What are you running from? The clay demon?
6192355000995052 Right… I suppose people jumping from its windows just wanted to let some air in.
6192355000276345 It's foul. Cramped. Suffocating. Too high, too concrete. But safe.
6192355000277551 I don't understand what you mean.
6192355000277552 What evil?
6192355001029753 塔雅 泰吉… So she's in there, huh?
6192355001029758 Yeah, I already know she's in there. I, too, would have liked to see her.
6192355000276350 Why speak of it? Evil is coming, yargachin. You know it too.\nInside lives 塔雅, Overseer 泰吉's daughter. She can protect us from any evil. No harm will befall the place where Mother Superior lives.
6192355001029755 And I was just looking for her.
6192355001029754 Yes.
6192355000995070 I've got nothing to tell you.
6192355000995069 …Right. I couldn't persuade 大 维拉德. Here's your money.
6192355001029761 Well, here's what I'll say: You were wrong to have come to this town. You should have stayed back in the steppe.
6192355000995068 Have you forgotten out faces already? We asked you for help. We wanted to be let into the Warrens.
6192355000995072 I had to spend it. Sorry.
6192355000995073 Oh yeah… here is it. Have it back.
6192355000995071 What about our money?
6192355001029760 Children of many mothers, aren't you… Even Mother Boddho caresses your step still.
6192355001029764 Lucky you.
6192355001029759 We went to the Warren, we stood by its walls, we hoped to be let in the ark. The pest is spreading across the Town, we wanted to hide.\nIf we can't get to Mother 塔雅, we can at least find refuge at 萨巴. She is also like a mother to us. She will teach us how to protect ourselves.
6192355001029763 你是谁?
6192355001029762 Bite kharaan, you're back. What say you?
6192355000449758 Khatangher
6192355000302079 你是谁?
6192355000302084 Not to suck up Drink; that is the Law. Are you not Men?
6192355000302078 Not to go on all-Fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?
6192355000302081 Why you, though? I'll talk to her.
6192355000302085 I am.
6192355000302080 Our Mother Superior, joy of our people, long expected you. Speak, now, to me.
6192355000302083 I'd rather just listen.
6192355000302086 I'd rather look around.
6192355000302082 It is all the same. Mother Superior has hundreds of eyes, ears, and hands. We are all one. This tongue is her tongue. These ears are her ears. I have long waited for you, guest. Speak. I will listen.
6192355000302088 Why won't you let her out of her room?
6192355000302089 I want to inspect the Termitary.
6192355000302087 Mother Superior, joy of our people, wants you to lead us away into the steppe. We want to go home. \nHave you not heard her? She likes not this place. This evil cesspit overflows with ennui and misery.
6192355000302091 为什么？
6192355000302092 Is this because of your riot? Are you still losing your minds?
6192355000302090 Impossible. It is dangerous out there.
6192355000302094 I hear screams. That means some people are alive out there. Comforting.
6192355000302095 Yeah, yeah. "Are you not Men?"
6192355000302096 So it <i>is</i> about the riot…
6192355000302093 This is not to be spoken of. Or there will be punishment. Such is the Law.
6192355000302098 Where is he?
6192355000302099 No, I haven't seen him. Who's this "udurgh?"
6192355000302097 I, Mother Superior, joy of our people, now grant you an audience. Have you seen already how the udurgh suffers without our care? Have you leaned against his ear? Have you tasted his humors? Or have you quenched his thirst?
6192355000302108 In here, too?
6192355000302107 Everywhere.
6192355000302110 How do I get to him?
6192355000302111 I've heard that already.
6192355000302109 It is a creature that contains the world within it. How else could I put it?
6192355000302113 I've been there, back when I was a kid. It's empty.
6192355000302114 Look at what? The stars? The Lines are truly everywhere.
6192355000302112 You'll see for yourself if you go to the old village and look closely. Very closely.
6192355000500152 
6192355000611951 Mother's Attendant
6192355000284468 He ordered you? When? He's… he's dead.
6192355000284469 Some secret if he invited people in. Any random stranger could know!
6192355000284467 A key to the secret shelter your good 父亲 used to cure people. He ordered me to relay it to you. Respectfully, I obey. Here is the key.
6192355000284471 All right.
6192355000284472 I laid him to his final rest myself. Let us not cling to false hope.
6192355000284470 What makes you think he's dead? People like Old 布拉克 are above death. They cannot be vanished. Take the key, and see for yourself.
6192355000284474 When did 父亲 give you the key? He died three days ago!
6192355000284475 I wonder what kind of work needs to be hidden from The Powers That Be.
6192355000284473 Indeed… Why does everyone call it secret, then? Perhaps it was only concealed from the people he wanted to hide his work from. Such as the powers that be. And us common people, we know everything.

6192355000451853 Don't forget orange. That one's nice too.
6192355000451851 White, yellow, red, blue, green…
6192355000451855 What?
6192355000451856 Is it working?
6192355000451857 I doubt you'll make it come in sooner.
6192355000451854 Train-summoning.
6192355000451859 Can I help?
6192355000451860 I sure am. Eat healthy, and you'll be just as big.
6192355000451861 I'm not a hunchback, I'm just tired.
6192355000451858 Why do you ask, Uncle Hunchback? And you're so huge... like a giant!
6192355000451863 Is it like tug-of-war?
6192355000451864 Do you all call at once, or take turns?
6192355000451862 There's too few of us. Not enough power.
6192355000451866 Depends on the train.
6192355000451867 I used to, but it's been a while…
6192355000451865 Actually… You are really big. Maybe you <i>can</i> help. Do you know how to train-summon?
6192355000451869 Definitely.
6192355000451870 Well… I can try.
6192355000451871 Nah, maybe you should go on without me.
6192355000451868 Look. First you have to wish really, really hard for it to come. Can you do that?
6192355000451873 "Inevitable."
6192355000451874 "Black."
6192355000451875 "Abrupt."
6192355000451876 "Iron."
6192355000451877 …No, I can't. I'm not good with words.
6192355000451872 Next, you have to give it a name. It needs to be an adjective. So that it'll be adjacent. Got it?
6192355000451879 Perhaps I'll try. Later.
6192355000451880 Fine, if I don't have to say it out loud. At least I won't look stupid.
6192355000451881 Nah, guys, this is too much. See you around.
6192355000451878 Last, find the dead end of a railroad—the southernmost one that goes into the steppe and curves a bit. Stand there and think real hard about how it needs to come soon, and call it by the name held in your mind.\nWill you?
6192355000451883 Yeah. Food would be a nice delivery, too.
6192355000451884 Candy?
6192355000451885 Two weeks? Huh. That's never happened before.
6192355000451882 Two weeks late already. And I'm waiting for a wonderful parcel…
6192355000451887 Well… Sounds cool.
6192355000451888 A whole parcel full of stamps? You're very lucky.
6192355000451886 Nope. Stamps. And my daddy's peaked cap from the war.
6192355000451890 For the train? Try swearing.
6192355000451891 Those names seem fine.
6192355000451892 What about Hurricane?
6192355000451889 Racing train. Fast-faster-fastest train. Speedy. Lightning-quick. Uh… Immediate. Ugh… I guess I'm choosing wrong names.
6192355000449755 Kid
6192355000724479 What play is it?
6192355000724482 I'm not a theatregoer. Never understood the appeal.
6192355001569309 So, you don't have much stage property? This place looks empty.
6192355000469967 Our theatre has seen better days. The repertory is getting stale. Same play, over and over again. It's beginning to get on my nerves.
6192355000724484 What do you mean?
6192355000724485 They used to act out old steppe rites here when I was a kid…
6192355001582851 Like you don't have a more cheerful subject… Say, life.
6192355000724483 It's about death. Hot on its trail, so to speak.\nI've already tried to stage this study once, but it didn't work out. The acting was bad. No one understood what they were playing. How can you be a 凯恩, a 布拉克, or Sinister 卡特琳娜 if you don't walk their paths? No one grasped their character.\nThis time it will be different.
6192355000724493 Conversations like this make my head hurt.
6192355001582854 Intricate.
6192355001582855 What's the point?
6192355000724486 I want full authenticity. I will move the play outside, into the streets.\nActors play out real events while being in the middle of them. The audience doesn't know they're in a play. The actors, that they're being watched. Such is my method…
6192355000724491 Not really. They just have a different attitude toward it.
6192355000724492 Muu Shubuun is not a mask of death. It's actually more about life.
6192355000724490 We have a ton of steppe theatre costumes in the storeroom. Especially those wicked birds, Muu Shubuun. The ones that symbolize death. Do steppe people like the play with death?
6192355001569295 Just how rough are we talking here?
6192355001582856 Is the outside not cruel enough for you?
6192355001569294 The actor must understand how to work death. I'm not making this one for the audience, but for the actors themselves. <i>Their inner world</i> is the stage. Their worldview.\nHence the… unusual methods. Unusual and rough. It's the theatre of cruelty.
6192355001569297 Me? No. I'm just curious.
6192355001569298 I'm not an actor. From what I can tell, I'm one of the people your actors will play. A person directly involved in the events.
6192355001569299 Sure.
6192355001569296 Look, I do what the subject demands of me. I'll set your tasks gradually and uncover the method step by step—else you'll sabotage the process.\nYou're here for an audition, after all, aren't you?
6192355001569301 What method?
6192355001569300 Curious. But I'm not interested in costumes.\nI'm interested in showing the authentic relationship of man and death. Stage props are unneeded for that; what one needs is a method.
6192355001569303 What play are you staging?
6192355001569308 What do you mean?
6192355001569302 No one does. Old theatre is dead. The building we're standing in is just a shell of a theatre. A cocoon, an abandoned chrysalis, hell, maybe even a coffin, should the play be a flop.\nYou know, the world's a stage—I've truly taken that to heart.
6192355001582853 Killing actors for real?
6192355001582852 It's one and the same. Especially considering my new method.
6192355001582858 为什么？
6192355001582857 It's a different kind of cruelty, not the one you're used to. Being unforgiving towards yourself, mostly… but you need not concern yourself with this…
6192355001424453 I don't know.
6192355001437556 What do you mean?
6192355001437557 I'm dead tired…
6192355001424451 你是谁?
6192355001431016 A person.
6192355001437560 No one.
6192355001437561 阿泰米 布拉克.
6192355001437564 Why do you ask?
6192355001431015 Who <i>are</i> you?
6192355001431018 I told you already.
6192355001437555 Is this some kind of game?
6192355001437558 Ugh.
6192355001437562 A haruspex. A Warden. A Knower-of-Lines.
6192355001437563 The man who tore this town apart and bound it back together.
6192355001431017 Who are <i>you?</i>
6192355001431020 Here.
6192355001431021 Back here. I came round, I guess.
6192355001437559 I'm… everywhere.
6192355001431019 Where are you?
6192355001431023 Observe what? Calculate what?
6192355001431022 I was desperate, at first. I thought we'd failed utterly.\nLike the astronomers of old, you know? The eclipse is short, it ends in the blink of an eye, and we missed the chance to observe and calculate everything we needed… and the next opportunity is a century out.
6192355001437552 I don't think anything.
6192355001437553 "Come round"? I didn't faint.
6192355001437554 Back where?
6192355001437551 Look who's here… Time to get real, then. You wanted to come round. Let's see if it worked.\nSo, what do you think? Are you back?
6192355001437566 How do you see it going?
6192355001437567 So there'll be another performance?
6192355001437568 A flop? You're too harsh.
6192355001437565 Humanity. Their limits. Their struggle to conquer death.\nThis play wasn't the best. A flop, honestly. But it wasn't useless. I see much clearer now… and I know how to improve it. The next show will be better!
6192355001437570 I think you're the one obsessed with death.
6192355001437573 Uh huh. Good luck with the smartass. He'll surely win.
6192355001437569 We chose the wrong hero: someone who didn't fear death at all. Disrespectful, crude, and flippant.\nWe'll use a different archetype next time. A person obsessed with the idea of defeating death. Death's nemesis, so to speak… Someone who has <i>studied</i> it. 
6192355001437572 为什么？ Wasn't this one tortuous enough?
6192355001437571 Of course. The show must go on.
6192355001437575 I'm all ears.
6192355001437574 Death cannot be defeated, but it can be overcome. Not by prolonging life, no—the struldbrug method is ridiculous and stupid. People aren't yet strong enough to bear their own internal hell, or rid themselves of it.\nThat's not how you overcome death. We've found the true way.
6192355001437577 I don't remember… I didn't count.
6192355001437578 One.
6192355001437579 None.
6192355001437580 I'm 布拉克. I'm not an actor.
6192355001437576 How many of you were here—the actors who played the Haruspex?
6192355001437582 Around, somewhere… on his own.
6192355001437583 He belonged to history… or just a story? In any case, you knew about his adventures beforehand. You <i>planned</i> them.
6192355001437584 Gradually, the actor became him. They would only act the part while replaying a section… and <i>become</i> Haruspex upon unlocking new events.
6192355001437585 When one died, another took their place. This line is made of small segments. It could be infinite… if not in length, then in width.
6192355001437581 Where was the real Haruspex?
6192355001437587 They're broken into many separate beings.
6192355001437588 They step out of their feeble body.
6192355001437589 They transcend the self. That's what the sand pest tried to do. Depersonalize us.
6192355001437586 How does one overcome death?
6192355001437591 You're right. To connect two things, you must first break them apart, because connection implies difference… and previous separation. Only connections defeat death.
6192355001437592 That sounds too complicated.
6192355001437593 This makes no sense.
6192355001437594 But this doesn't solve the death of the physical body, and bodies matter. Even towns have bodies. Even people who become towns do.
6192355001437590 The body is susceptible to death! As is the self. As is any being trapped within its bounds. They invite death the way a lantern invites insects!\nBut that which is broken into many bodies, many selves, many perceptions—<i>that</i> thing can resist it.
6192355001437596 Whoever.
6192355001437597 I'm 阿泰米·布拉克.
6192355001437598 That's no one's business but mine.
6192355001437599 This question is a trap.
6192355001437595 "I have been in a multitude of shapes, before I assumed a consistent form," as an ancient poet once said. 你是谁?
6192355001437601 No. I've found myself, and that's who I'm going to stay. I am 阿泰米 布拉克. I don't want to take this mask off. I'm going back to the Town. Back there I'm expected… and loved.
6192355001437602 Thank you. The act has worn thin, and I don't want to play anymore. So I guess I exit through the small door to the right—the dressing room… and go back home.
6192355001437603 Another trap? I don't want to choose a door. What if I stay here, in the Theatre? Maybe even take your place? Would you like that, dear Mark?
6192355001437604 It's all over anyway. This choice is meaningless.
6192355001437605 But what does that mean for me…?
6192355001437600 Our work here is done. You can go to the dressing room and take off the costume. Remember the place? It's where you started.\nGood luck. And thank you for taking part in our daring experiment.
6192355000776085 What did I do that's so wrong?
6192355001427580 I'm not in the habit of lying.
6192355001427583 All of… who? This place is always pretty empty.
6192355000776084 Listen! What have you <i>done?</i> How could this happen? You lied to me, didn't you? And not just me, to all of us!
6192355001427560 Well, it's not like I've missed my train…
6192355001427561 What? Did the play start already?
6192355001427559 You're late.
6192355001427563 I was busy.
6192355001427570 Actually, I wasn't planning on coming here in the first place.
6192355001427562 Who knows…
6192355001427565 Shame about that.
6192355001427571 What's wrong this time?
6192355001427572 No, I haven't.
6192355001427564 On the contrary, the play is over. And, yet again, it's over because you have failed at your task.
6192355001427567 I'm afraid I'm hopeless.
6192355001427573 I don't know what you want from me.
6192355001427566 You were late! You didn't make it in time, do you understand? A theatre is all about being <i>on time!</i> To the minute! Being late is unforgivable. One person is late, and everything is ruined.\nYou've let everybody down. Everybody! I don't even know how I'm supposed to go on working with you. It will never come to anything, this way. Anything <i>whatsoever.</i>
6192355001427575 Is this another one of your techniques?
6192355001427569 Actually, I think it's better this way.
6192355001427574 What bliss. Free at last!
6192355001427568 …I am forced to cancel the rehearsal. You're free to go.
6192355001427579 What now?
6192355001427576 No, I'm done with techniques. I'm letting you go.
6192355001427582 Failed it how?
6192355001427584 Damn… I think I'm starting to understand.
6192355001427581 You've ruined everything for me… Everything. This entire production—the action, the challenge, the pain and peril, the brilliant blasphemy—it was all for the sake of the experiment.\nAnd I told you about it! It was a test! A test of humanity's limits. An exercise in transcending those limits. You failed.
6192355001427586 Yes. I did.
6192355001427587 So what if I did? It's not like you ever explain anything!
6192355001427588 I was… having a hard time with all those additional burdens.
6192355001427591 I thought it was part of the show.
6192355001427585 Did you make a deal? Here on this stage? Did you? Answer me!
6192355001427590 But 为什么？ What's the point?
6192355001427589 Of course, it was hard! That was the idea behind your ascension! How can anyone be made to feel the heroic torment of Sisyphus if they're given a paper boulder to roll?
6192355001427593 So what now?
6192355001427592 Maybe… maybe. This production had quite a number of, shall we say, <i>unplanned parts.</i>
6192355001427595 You tell me!
6192355001427598 I don't know, all right?
6192355001427599 I wasn't exactly playing games, here!
6192355001427594 Because… because in this play, death becomes your partner! Understand? Humanity's most immutable, unconquerable limit!\nYou and death are in dialogue, don't you see? So how do we make your triumph convincing? How can you make it feel real? <i>How?</i> I'm asking you—<i>you!</i>
6192355001427597 为什么？
6192355001427596 And so you lost. Everyone lost, because of that.
6192355001427601 Why all the dumb burdens, then?
6192355001427604 So you're trying to say… that's how you defeat death? Are you joking?
6192355001427605 Why does life get harder with all these… layers? These repetitions? These continuations, these intersections… They're a goddamn mess!
6192355001427600 The moment you die, you come into contact with death. What kind of contact? A moment of valor, or idiocy? No one knows! But it is a brush with death. Thus, a connection—a state of attainment. Understand?\nBut why am I even asking you? I still don't entirely understand this myself!
6192355001427603 Why are you so upset, pal?
6192355001427602 I… I wasn't exactly playing games here, either!
6192355001427607 So what happens now?
6192355001427606 I told you, didn't I? It all went right over your head. We needed it for… candidness! For understanding! For the connection, and the attainment! Not to mention the <i>experience.</i> \nAnd here you are. I'm disappointed in you.
6192355001427609 You'll work with this one, I presume?
6192355001427617 That's regrettable. I am what I am…
6192355001427608 Now? Now I'm going to work with someone else, obviously. I'm not interested in you anymore. Not interested in you as a character, you understand? A character. Not a human. You're simply too… dense.
6192355001427611 Ahh. He's going to put you through a world of hurt.
6192355001427612 Well, then. It's the best choice you could make. Keep working—I won't distract you any further.
6192355001427613 So, a new one… That means the old one existed for a reason, too.
6192355001427610 Yes. I need someone who feels more indignation, respect, and reverence toward death than you. Someone… passionate, if you will.\nSo, with your permission, I'll get back to him and we'll continue discussing his part. And my new plans concerning his part.
6192355001427615 Where do I get my exit fee?
6192355001427616 Well… Goodbye, then.
6192355001427614 Yes. Possibly. I think so.
6192355001427619 But what about tomorrow?
6192355001427622 As you wish… but you're making a mistake.
6192355001427618 Go through that door—no, not the main entrance; the small one to the right of you. Into the storeroom. \nGet changed there, and then go back where you came from. You'll settle your account behind the same door. The Town is off-limits to you from now on.
6192355001427621 Farewell.
6192355001427623 Good luck… on your next try.
6192355001427620 It's not coming. Nor will there be any other… solutions. It's the price you must pay for your cowardice.
6192355001253560 You mean the gallows? Reckon we'll spectate—or go on stage?
6192355001418267 I wouldn't call it an invitation.
6192355001253559 Oh, so you've been invited to this performance, too?
6192355001254052 Are 审判官s actors?
6192355001563830 I don't think so.
6192355001254051 All the world's a stage. Sometimes a gallows stage.\nI foresee a unique experience. We are about to witness a most exquisite one-woman show. I suggest you keep track of it, and learn her devices. It'll come in handy.
6192355001254054 That was a compliment so bac可汗ded I could see through it.
6192355001418271 I've improvised once or twice already… and yeah. I think I'll pass now.
6192355001254053 Absolutely. Her role is difficult, though, so do play along. Improvise. Drop a brick or two, derail her with your silly trains of thought—you know the drill.
6192355001418269 Entrance, pah… I feel like I'll <i>exit</i> that place feet first.
6192355001418270 We'll see.
6192355001418268 A powerful performance requires a strong entrance.
6192355001563828 Guess we'll have to accept our fate, whatever it is.
6192355001563829 Inside? That's not a performance, just a run-through. Meaning she'll probably run each of us through with something sharp.
6192355001563827 Well, we won't direct this play, that's for sure. But I was talking about what awaits us inside.

6192355001258462 马克·英摩泰尔
6192355000313752 What is there to be afraid of?
6192355000313753 I know who you are. You're the kids from 父亲's list.
6192355000313751 Don't be afraid. We're all on the same side for now. Aren't we?
6192355000313757 There are seven of you. But there was an eighth on the list. Where is he?
6192355000313755 We're all grateful to you. We know protecting us isn't easy, but you still do it. You make sure we live.
6192355000313759 Is he behind that door?
6192355000313760 I can't see him.
6192355000313758 Here. For now. He's the udurgh.
6192355000313762 为什么？
6192355000313763 No, I don't know yet.
6192355000313764 What's behind the door?
6192355000313761 We think it's your 父亲 behind the door. But maybe the Eighth is transitioning already… Have you discovered who he is? We're curious too.
6192355000313766 What's an udurgh?
6192355000313767 How do you know that word?
6192355000313768 I want to go back.
6192355000313765 Because he's the udurgh. If he lives, so do we. If he begins to die, so will be.
6192355000313770 为什么？
6192355000313771 This door leads nowhere. There's just more of the same behind it.
6192355000313769 You think you can't see the Eighth because you're looking the wrong way. But he's here. It's fortunate he's still on this side.
6192355000313773 Why is the Eighth nameless?
6192355000313774 I'll open it.
6192355000313772 We don't know. And neither will you. We can't enter yet. Nor do we want to. No one does.

6192355000347652 Okay. Thank you for this gift.
6192355000347653 They mixed pills together? Sounds like a recipe for disaster.
6192355000347654 \n…Y'know what? Have your poison back. I don't need it.
6192355000347651 Didn't we tell you? We used to play a game of "sand pest." Meaning we needed to make medicine, right? So the kids who played it ground pills together and mixed the powders.\nRumor has it, one mixture really did work. But no one remembers which one. The kids who made it have long since grown up.
6192355000347656 Got it.
6192355000347657 Weird… but sure, let's roll with it.
6192355000347658 You children play some strange games.
6192355000347655 It can kill you, for sure. They say it's like lighting a coal fire in your belly—makes your stomach bleed. But it does cure the sand pest, got it?
6192355000347661 Hold your horses. What's this stuff anyway?
6192355000347662 Isn't it too precious to share with me?
6192355000347663 Why would you give me something so rare?
6192355000347660 I have. Thanks.
6192355000347659 Have you eaten the shmowder? C'mon, hurry up.
6192355000347665 So what exactly does this stuff do?
6192355000347664 I have no choice. One must keep a clean conscience. You taught us that murder is wrong, didn't you?
6192355000347667 I see. So what exactly does this stuff do?
6192355000347668 And who is it that you plan on killing, boy?
6192355000347666 You told us it's fine to kill bad people, didn't you? So I'm silencing my own conscience, I guess. Asking for forgiveness in advance.
6192355000347670 So what's in the box?
6192355000347669 None of your business, big guy. No one, perhaps.
6192355000347672 I already have.
6192355000347673 It's fine. I'll keep it for a while.
6192355000347671 Hurry up and take it. Time is of the essence.
6192355000347675 Yeah. You keep it that way.
6192355000347676 Fine, I've changed my mind. I'll keep it.
6192355000347674 Whatever. We'll find a use for it, of course. I did offer it to you though, so my conscience is clean.
6192355001492380 Your scout is a bit too young. I don't like it.
6192355001495551 Are you their leader, 诺克金?
6192355001492379 My scouts reported that you blacked out in the Town. I came here to check on you.\nYou look better than you did two minutes ago. Have you taken the immunity boosters?
6192355001495553 Let's talk, then.
6192355001495552 It's dangerous to just lie down in the streets here, especially if you're still alive. Our scouts were brave to use their medicine dragging you out.\nStill, we need to talk about this.
6192355001495555 为什么？
6192355001495556 The last thing I want is for you to play medical personnel! We have orderlies—the beakheads. No beak, no business in infected districts!
6192355001495557 Are you afraid of infection? You lurk in those districts anyway, making that map of yours…
6192355001495554 I gave them an order to not assist any more infected people. Unless it's one of ours.
6192355001495559 And neither of those is your business!
6192355001495563 I can't believe my ears. Could it be that at least one of my pleas got through to you?
6192355001495558 It's one thing to walk the streets, another to touch the sick. You know the difference.
6192355001495561 I won't fall.
6192355001495565 Thank heavens!
6192355001495560 We're low on immunity boosters, and we're entirely out of shmowders.\nWhat I mean is, be careful. If you fall in the street again, we can't help.
6192355001589359 Says the big one.
6192355001589360 Let's say I believed you.
6192355001589358 He's not a scout. He's an aide. I mean, I can't just expel him, can I? But we don't let the little ones anywhere dangerous.
6192355001589362 Don't talk back to me.
6192355001589363 Anyway. You gave the right order.
6192355001589361 Look who's talking.
6192355000447053 诺克金
6192355000348958 
6192355000348959 
6192355000348957 
6192355000348961 你几岁了，孩子？
6192355000348962 It does resemble that. I thought about it, too.
6192355000348960 This track is an umbilical cord. Our only connection to the outside world.
6192355000348964 Yeah. 你说起话来像三十岁的人。
6192355000348965 I've noticed. You two are weird.
6192355000348963 Six, if Mother is not mistaken. But I'm not sure. I'm worse with numbers than words.
6192355000348967 Of course I have. We could use one, these days.
6192355000348968 I thought they were disbanded two years ago.
6192355000348966 This umbilical cord needs to be cut. Quickly. Sand pest flows through it. And a special emissary will arrive soon. A state 审判官. Heard of those?
6192355000348970 You mean like… blow it up?
6192355000348971 No. I'm a different kind of surgeon.
6192355000348969 No. This emissary will signal our doom. As we sentence the outside world, so will the 审判官 sentence us. But they're faster. Get it? The umbilical cord needs to be cut. \nPerhaps you can do it? You're a surgeon, after all.
6192355000348973 What, the rails? I'd just blunt the blade.
6192355000348974 A contraption would serve better. I think I know just the man…
6192355000348972 Sure, as an example. I'm not an expert. I'm only six, after all.\nJust destroy the rails. Or we're all dead. State emissaries have no sense of humor. Maybe a scalpel will do? Just cut and be done with it.
6192355000795262 Measly
6192355000348976 你是谁 talking about, kid?
6192355000348977 Heh. Those are some thoughtful flowers.
6192355000348975 I'm trying to divine who it will be. A man or woman? If a man… there will be blood, but it'll be easier for you to prevail, in the end. If a woman… less of our blood, more of yours. That's what my flowers tell me.
6192355000348979 Come on. Our town is hospitable. We honor old traditions.
6192355000348980 It doesn't take a flower to predict our chances of survival.
6192355000348978 We're expecting guests. Bad guests. Violent. So I'm asking my flowers if we'll survive. They're not sure…
6192355000795263 Thrush
6192355000358452 Humbly?听起来不像是胖维拉德.
6192355000358453 Too bad. I'm busy enough as it is.
6192355000358454 Tell him I'll come by as soon as I have the time.
6192355000358451 My master, 维拉德·奥吉姆斯基, humbly requests your presence. It concerns a most urgent matter.
6192355000358456 Ah, that changes everything.
6192355000358457 You think Fat 维拉德's days are numbered? He'll outlive us all yet.
6192355000358458 I can't. I'm busy.
6192355000358455 Apologies, I should have been more clear. 我家主人是小奥吉姆斯基。Younger for now, anyway.
6192355000795264 信使
6192355000358464 You simply spawned from the Earth.
6192355000358465 Mother Boddho made you out of what was left over after making humans.
6192355000358466 You mean according to legend? Same way the Shabnak did. The Earth molds you out of her innards, and spits you out.
6192355000358463 It is good that you listen, yargachin. Do you know how we 虫人came into being?
6192355000358468 But you do also possess the weaknesses of flesh, no?
6192355000358469 Quite a deal you've got there. What could possibly threaten the Earth itself?
6192355000358467 That is right. Our nature is twofold. We're part Earth, part flesh. That is why we possess properties of the Earth, shүү dee. What is no threat to Earth, is no threat to us.
6192355000358471 Yes, a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Always.
6192355000358472 What makes you think the disease comes from the Earth?
6192355000358470 We took some properties of flesh, yes? And some from Earth. Joined, they became something new. We've learned to sense herbs. We've learned to understand cattle. We are unaffected by a disease that Earth created.
6192355000358474 So, the usual… Whatever happens, it's Mother Boddho doing it.
6192355000358475 No. You haven't convinced me.
6192355000358476 That's… possible.
6192355000358473 Where else? All grows from Earth. When she is joyous, she fills the fields with twyre. When she is irate, she makes shabnak, pits, and disease. Those do not affect us. We are one with Earth.

6192355000367377 劳拉·拉薇尔
6192355000370452 I plan to go on with my life.
6192355000370455 I want to leave. This town has nothing else to offer me.
6192355000370453 Actually, I don't know what to do.
6192355000370454 Where should I go? What should I start with?
6192355000370451 Where go you, friend? What plan is next to follow?
6192355000370457 The townsfolk?
6192355000370458 Who cares about their babbling…
6192355000370456 What say the townsfolk?
6192355000370460 Why should I care?
6192355000370461 A hive? A swarm? A flock?
6192355000370459 They're so alike, aren't they? A backdrop, faceless… They surely know nothing important—right?\nA hive, a swarm, a flock: no use for names. Whatever one knows, they shall all know in turn. 
6192355000370463 Oh yeah, they were eager to communicate with me yesterday. My ears are still ringing.
6192355000370464 I can feel it. Kind of slimy to the touch.
6192355000370465 Sounds unpleasant. A mouthful.
6192355000370462 The crowd is but a many-headed beast. Like it or not: You are but one such head. They know you better than you know yourself. Have you heard them, 布拉克? Communication: See how it means finding a common ground?
6192355000370467 So I'm the only one who knows nothing.
6192355000370470 But you said they're a swarm, all alike.
6192355000370466 They all know something of your tale, 布拉克. And from each one, a different strand of it. Some know where you're to go. Others, will say why you must go. And some will warn of danger, terrible danger, that you may avoid it.
6192355000370472 I'm used to only relying on myself.
6192355000370475 No one's lips. I don't care for gossip.
6192355000370471 Untrue! Grown-ups will know what children don't. And children know what steppe Kin do not. Such is the mechanism of life, that turns in its own petty pace from day to day. You choose only whose lips reach your raised ears.
6192355000370474 I don't like children.
6192355000370476 I guess I should go looking for a child…
6192355000370477 But what should I do exactly? Where should I go next?
6192355001523952 Talked to them already.
6192355000370473 That is because you are alone, 布拉克. Confused, alone, losing the plot, 布拉克! Does not the map of your own mind suffice? Then talk! Communicate.\nHere, hear me now: Teensies and tots, the town's own young, indeed already know who waits for you today. If you still doubt: Then speak to one. Any child.
6192355000370479 They talk about so many things…
6192355000370480 They're too fickle. They say one thing at dawn, and another at dusk.
6192355000370478 Talk to the crowd, 布拉克! To faceless folk, all so alike in their great numbers. Hear them: the buzzing swarm, the squawking flock—the scent, the trail you seek is there in what they say. For life is what they talk about. \nAnd see, 布拉克, a doctor's path is too about life.

6192355000379007 我想先找个位子坐一下。Looks like I'm in for something interesting.
6192355000379008 所以这就是你们审判官。和我预料的不一样。
6192355000379009 承担后果?当然。
6192355000379010 我不需要说实话？还能这样？
6192355000379006 这将会是个很长的谈话。你必须集中所有主意。\n你不需要说实话，但是撒谎是要承担后果的。准备好了吗？ wquences. Ready?
6192355000379012 I think we already have.
6192355000379013 You're the one in charge.
6192355000379011 Lies are much more informative, even if the truth saves us both time. Shall we begin?
6192355000379015 这可由不得我来评判。
6192355000379016 我，首先，非常累。.We've seen too much over the last week to be afraid of you.
6192355000379019 你已经开始提问了吗？
6192355000379014 Are you that cynical, or that brave? 你看起不像是个笨蛋。
6192355000379021 我会。
6192355000379022 我不会。
6192355000379023 这不是提问，这是挑衅。
6192355000379020 我们先从一个经典问题开始。\nWould you push an obnoxious fat man in front of a trolley to keep four children from being run over?
6192355000379027 瞧，为什么你要问我这个？ 你不是来找我谈论这种事情的吧。
6192355000379028 除非我真正面临这种状况，否则我无法做出选择，希望这种事不要真的发生。
6192355000379029 他们反正都会杀死所有人的，我绝不妥协。
6192355000379030 I'll choose one.
6192355000379031 我没有女儿。也许我们应该谈论一下正经事？
6192355000379026 我明白了。\n第二个问题。士兵将处决你的两个女儿。如果你主动提供一个，他们会只开枪打她一人。 如果你拒绝合作，他们会开枪打死两人。\n你会怎么选择？
6192355000379033 我可以猜猜看。
6192355000379032 ...你是个令我惊奇的人，阿泰米·布拉克。 Your speech has a unusual cadence to it. A rare thing, indeed.\nBut I believe I have now attuned myself to you. 你知道我为什么在这吗？Do you know why I am here?
6192355000379035 我<i>已经</i> 做出了解药。给你。
6192355001280753 I我<i>已经</i> 做出了解药。几小时之前。
6192355000379036 谁和你说这些的，我很好奇？
6192355000379037 Words, words, words.
6192355000379034 我听说你熟稔对当地的传说和医学，和其对人体不同寻常的看法。我也听说你一直在研发治愈这场疾病的解药。\nAnd as there can be no cure, this is merely sabotage, am I correct?
6192355000379039 能。我猜。
6192355000379040 我不知道。
6192355000379041 我现在怀疑不能，它需要一种根本不存在的生物。
6192355000379038 所以解药是否能被生产？
6192355000379043 他曾经是。
6192355000379046 你知道他怎么了吗？
6192355000379042 我被告知他是你的一位亲密朋友。
6192355000379045 我只知道他死了，没别的了。
6192355000379047 他怎么死了？
6192355000379050 这个...倒并不出乎意料。
6192355000379044 鲁宾今夜死了。你没听说吗？ 
6192355000379049 毫无头绪。
6192355000379251 他表现得有些奇怪，最近。
6192355000379252 I think he wanted to make up for his… outburst.
6192355000379253 Passing the torch to me, so to speak.
6192355000379048 It doesn't matter, now. What matters is why he sent the sample on your behalf rather than his own.
6192355000379255 测试过了。它起作用了。
6192355000379256 还没。
6192355000379254 ...令人欣慰。这个巧合太棒了，简直难以置信。\n布拉克,你让我感到惊讶。你已经测试过它了吗？ 
6192355000379258 你关心哪四个人的性命？
6192355000379261 我没有配方。
6192355000379262 原料是个问题。我不知道哪能获得。 
6192355000379257 一个能治愈沙疫的解药改变了...许多事情。上千性命的生死问题，但是我现在我现在只关心其中四人的生死。\n现在我需要配方，和获得原料的方法。给我。
6192355000379260 我可以猜。
6192355000379263 我不在乎。
6192355000379264 我们先处理一下疾病的问题，等会再吵。
6192355000379259 ...布拉克，你疯了吗？你是不是不知道我是什么人，以及现在的状况？ 
6192355000379266 大部分是血，其次是草药酊剂。我们运气不错，现在九月正是蓷薾盛开的时候。
6192355000379265 这个样本是用什么做的？
6192355000379268 不。我不知道这是谁的血。
6192355000379267 是被感染的人血？
6192355000379270 或许。我不在乎。
6192355001074021 主宰？你在说些什么？
6192355000379269 ...我真不敢相信我 <i>听到的</i> 话，布拉克，我假设你一直在试图嘲讽我。那就容我以彼之道还施彼身了。\n你知不知道你的命运被严酷考验所主宰，而你仅仅想用几句莫名其妙的胡扯打发过去？你的命运已经被...切断了。我可以看得出，我很确定。
6192355000379272 我按照我理解的职责行动，如果某人试图利用我的行为达成他们的目的，我不在乎。y actions to their own ends, I don't care.
6192355000379273 我一直试图去做正确的事。 I don't care if someone orchestrates it. The heart is smarter than the brain.
6192355000379271 你什么意思？ 你就是那样麻木不仁吗？或者说你仅仅是不了解，成为某个比你强大的人的牵线木偶是件多么悲惨痛苦的事？? Or is it that l it is to remain a puppet in the hands of those more powerful than you?
6192355000379275 So there will be more at some point? Looking forward to it.
6192355000379276 …Do I see a hint of tears?
6192355000379274 ...你是个笨蛋。\nAlthough, perhaps… you're not the fool here. Go. 谈话结束。
6192355001074023 Do you really believe that?
6192355001074022 So you haven't even heard? That explains a lot.\nWell, you're quite popular around these parts. I've interrogated several dozen people, and nearly a third pin their hopes on you.\nAnd every other person says that Old 布拉克's heir is fated to drown the Town in blood. I believe that was foretold.
6192355001074025 No, where is it from?
6192355001074026 Yes. Well, let them talk, and believe whatever they want.
6192355001074024 I believe that a person's behavior is directly influenced by the few pieces of data that get stuck in their head.\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies. "Your children shall be kings," remember that?
6192355001074028 Can't say it bothers me.
6192355001074027 An old book.\nDo you realize that every step has already been foreseen and calculated? And I don't mean by myself. To be frank, your predestined future is not interesting enough to concern me.
6192355001280755 It can't be… He doesn't have the skill.
6192355001280756 …So that's what he was doing!
6192355001280757 I don't deserve the honor.
6192355001280754 An hour ago, I was brought a vial and a letter from one Stanislav 鲁宾. He claims the medicine is a tested serum—<i>the</i> serum—and that the Town owes its existence to you. Any comment?
6192355001411625 No. I'm good for now.
6192355001411626 我懂了。 Report daily—will do.
6192355001411627 I've got more… but I think I can hold them back for a bit longer. See you around.
6192355001411624 不要对我无力，布拉克. I won't have it. 你要每天向我汇报工作。Any more quips, or are we done?
6192355000517836 Are they in those sacks?
6192355000517839 Did you… count?
6192355000517835 …Seven thousand dead, more or less.
6192355000517838 Are there survivors?
6192355000517846 You were there?
6192355000517837 Yes. I have not seen so many corpses since the Battle of the Fords.
6192355000517841 You… feel sorry for them?
6192355000517840 Can't you hear the screams? There must be. But it hardly matters.
6192355000517843 Have you already figured out what happened?
6192355000517845 A death sentence? 为什么？
6192355000517842 I should say that I deserve more pity than they do. This is my death sentence, I believe.\nBut, oddly enough, it's them I think about. Even though they're beyond help.
6192355000517848 Are there any survivors here?
6192355000517847 No. Not during the battle itself. I arrived the next day.
6192355000520251 They wouldn't make it far. Without care, the infection kills within a day.
6192355000517850 I do. They were bottled up in here by 奥吉姆斯基. I will soon find out if he knew about the infection or not.\nWould it be better for the Town if they roamed the streets, seeking food and blood? I doubt it. Would they run off into the steppe and spread infection throughout the country? I wonder.
6192355000520253 Does that mean the Termitary is unlocked, now? Can the survivors come out?
6192355000520252 我是审判官。. I exist to solve clearly defined problems. If this town survives, so will I.\nThis mission is my last chance to prove my utility. If I fail… Let's just say I am not in good standing at the moment. I expect no lenience.
6192355000520255 How is it possible?
6192355000520256 How is your situation special?
6192355000520254 Curious.\nAlthough, even if the disease had crossed the steppe, technically I would have been beyond reproach. My task was to save the Town. I was never ordered to stop the epidemic.\nAlthough, who cares about formalities in my situation.
6192355000710088 Why is that?
6192355000710089 So those were crocodile tears.
6192355000710087 No. Not yet. Too early.
6192355000710091 I don't mean your <i>appearance.</i>
6192355000710092 Your teeth look plenty sharp to me.
6192355000710090 …Are you calling me a crocodile?
6192355000710094 You are wrong. They are strongly connected to it.
6192355000710095 Land—Earth—is the one thing they are attached to. Let them go.
6192355000710093 Our responsibility is not to the Town, but to the world at large, currently kept safe by your quarantine. And those people won't stay in the Town, they'll scatter. They're not attached to this land.
6192355000710097 Perhaps it <i>will</i> be me.
6192355000710098 他们不会离开这片大草原的。
6192355000710096 I'll think about it. But I won't believe the 奥吉姆斯基' assurances any longer. And who else could give me those? You? What's their word… "emshen"?
6192355001073952 That's what matters. I need to take care of her. Take her somewhere safe.
6192355001484065 什么？泰吉死了...? 
6192355001453655 不用担心我。我是金族人的一员，这就是我的家。
6192355001073951 不用找了。泰吉死了。不过我听说他女儿还活着。
6192355001073957 …
6192355001073958 ……
6192355001073959 ………
6192355001073956 On the other hand… Wait! Don't interrupt me. I'm thinking. Stand by.
6192355001073961 Thank you.
6192355001073962 Well, that was brutally honest.
6192355001073963 I don't get it. How… you know what, never mind.
6192355001073960 Fine. Have it your way.\nI am relieving the guards. The gate will be unlocked. I think I know an even better way to play this card.
6192355001073965 I'll go now.
6192355001073964 Precisely.
6192355001453654 上楼。去找工头泰吉。
6192355001453653 你要去哪？
6192355001484067 No… but that's one more tether snapped. Yet again I find myself with questions no one can answer…
6192355001484068 I guess the only hope left is that his daughter can replace him…
6192355001484066 Are you surprised?
6192355000552282 What do you mean, no?
6192355000552285 I see.
6192355000552281 No.
6192355000552286 Yes. It's about the 奥吉姆斯基.
6192355001073997 No. A question. Why are you here unguarded?
6192355000552283 Just in case. The answer is no. You had a request, did you not?
6192355000552288 They lie in a pit in the Termitary. The workers plan an execution.
6192355000552289 大 维拉德 went to the Termitary to protect his son.
6192355000552290 Young 维拉德 went to the Termitary to protect his 父亲.
6192355000552287 I plan to have a long conversation with all three 奥吉姆斯基.\nHm… I can tell by your look not all of them remain. What happened?
6192355000552301 What is it, then?
6192355001074010 To be honest… it's not my purpose, either. I keep forgetting that lately.
6192355000552300 I'm sorry. But I will not interfere. That is not what my purpose is.
6192355000552304 In that case, I think I should just go.
6192355001592007 …That's your impression? No one's ever called me that.
6192355000552302 Do you really think I'm about to explain it to you, in detail? Please don't dispel my impression that you're a smart man.
6192355001073999 Yeah? I haven't seen them around.
6192355001074011 Thanks for telling me that. It puts my mind at ease.
6192355001073998 I have a guard—a big one, too.
6192355001074001 Is there a way to protect the 奥吉姆斯基? It's urgent.
6192355001074002 Has anyone tried to assassinate you here?
6192355001074000 It's not the kind of guard you can see. Any other questions?
6192355001074004 It <i>was</i> support…
6192355001074007 You're shrewd, huh.
6192355001074009 Actually, I do have a request. 维拉德·奥吉姆斯基.
6192355001074003 Every day brings an attempt on my life. This whole damn mission is an attempt on my life. Have I not told you this already?\nBut I appreciate your support. If that's what this is.
6192355001074014 I'll have you know that they are free people. Free to do as they choose.
6192355001074015 One man can't order an entire people around.
6192355001074013 I wonder!
6192355001074017 If you foresaw this, why did you not interfere?
6192355001074018 Fine. Arrest me, then.
6192355001074016 We both know that's not true.
6192355001592009 Fair enough.
6192355001592010 What makes you say that?
6192355001592008 You've never spoken to an 审判官 before.
6192355001592012 你们审判官真奇怪。
6192355001592013 你猜对了。
6192355001592011 很明显。
6192355000697566 原牛已经灭绝了。
6192355000697567 为什么不能等了？
6192355000697586 我听说你被士兵抓起来了。
6192355000697589 让坏格里夫走，好吗？你需要他做什么？ 我能为他担保。
6192355000697565 搜寻万灵药的稀有原料忙得怎么样了，布拉克？你找到公牛了吗？我们不能够再等了。
6192355000697569 他们想做什么？
6192355000697568 军队已经来到小镇，想必你已经主意到了。
6192355000697571 我有新的主意了。
6192355001592453 我有了一些进展。
6192355000697570 他们的任务是摧毁小镇。我的是消灭暴乱的源头，但保留小镇。所以他们的到来是对我的死刑宣判。而且我没法阻止他们。\nThis brings us back to the subject of the panacea.
6192355000697573 我有新的主意了
6192355001496634 寻找血的源头。在这个问题上我已经取得了一些进展。
6192355000697572 那我们应该做什么呢？
6192355000697575 他做出疫苗了？
6192355000697574 ...我就指望你了。 Thought you were our best bet. Very well. It's good at least one of us still has their wits about them. 多亏丹考夫斯基我，有个主意了。
6192355000697577 所以呢？
6192355000697578 是的。疾病和大地联系在一起。
6192355000697576 没，但是他把我的目光投降这个不可能的建筑。 He's in love with it, I think. Particularly with how it stands straight without touching the ground. And is impenetrable to the disease.
6192355000697580 它是我不在的时候建造的。但是我知道当地小孩在那里搭了个住处。
6192355000697581 凯恩家从首都请来了一些疯子建筑师，再一次挑战可能性的极限。 
6192355000697582 我完全不知道它是什么做的...他们说超过两百个孩子和青少年住在那儿。它是怎么立起来的？
6192355000697583 它是大约六年前建造的？
6192355000697579 你知道那个塔是什么做的吗？它如何存在的？它形状背后的含义？\n这就是我最近一直研究的一切。 然后我发现了一些具有启发性的事实。
6192355000697585 不知道。
6192355001496649 你是审判官。我又不是。
6192355000697584 完全正确，意味着...?
6192355000697588 我不认为他们会这么做。
6192355000697587 他们还不敢。至少现在是这样的。
6192355000697591 例如？
6192355000833107 你告诉了他什么？关于人，和木偶？
6192355000697590 格里夫是自愿来找我的，没有任何人强迫他。我们有更紧迫的事。
6192355000697593 他们怎么个关联法？
6192355000697594 I'm flattered. Only that this game of yours is my whole life. 我能走了吗？
6192355000697592 我不就就会有证据。我的直觉从没让我失望过。 Except for this one time, with you… Still, I do not lose hope. The game isn't over, yet.
6192355000697596 Blood… Well, yeah. Blood, blood… 我一直在寻找它。我知道一切都和血紧密相关。
6192355001496650 我应该怎么做？
6192355000697595 以某种方式，布拉克。如果不可能突然变成了可能， someone must have paid a steep price indeed. The cost of such feats is usually measured in blood.
6192355000697598 好的。我现在就走。
6192355000697599 只是...不要打扰格里夫，好吗？ 他是个体面人，至少比大多数人体面。
6192355000697600 我很高兴看见你没有被捕。
6192355000697597 哪里有血，哪里就有万灵药。我需要一个停止炮击的理由。我会汇报疾病已经被治愈了。\nI'll be saved, too, but that hardly matters… The <i>Town</i> will be saved.
6192355000833109 是吗？那么的话，我该关心<i>什么</i>？
6192355000833108 这不是你该关心的问题，布拉克。他才需要考虑这些。
6192355001496631 奇怪的结论。你有证据吗？
6192355001498051 源头的事让其他人研究去吧...我只对治疗这场疾病感兴趣。
6192355001498455 怎么个关系密切？
6192355001496630 塔和暴乱的源头关系密切，布拉克。
6192355001496638 傲云，屠宰场的工头，从大草原回来了。他可能知道点什么。
6192355001496641 我想我要调查一下屠宰场...
6192355001496637 Report.
6192355001496640 我需要去一趟屠宰场。我一直想去一趟。
6192355001496639 你的傲云一无所知。He tried to find those… brontosauruses of yours in the steppe, only to learn they're extinct.有什么更好的主意吗？
6192355001496643 瞎蒙一气。
6192355001496644 我信任傲云。他答应我找出...
6192355001496642 你知道你在寻找什么吗？还是说只是瞎蒙一气？
6192355001496646 审判官又不是我！我已经竭尽全力。
6192355001496647 我知道。
6192355001496648 我不知道...
6192355001496645 我们已经没时间碰运气了，布拉克! 完全没有！
6192355001498457 这完全是八竿子打不着的事。它就是个建筑！能和疾病有什么关系？
6192355001498458 我希望你知道自己在做什么。
6192355001498456 但是你没法治愈它。你没有制作万灵药的原料。 Therefore, we must at least purge the source, so we can prevent this catastrophe from ever repeating. 同意吗？
6192355000698362 你...你怎么知道有关心脏的事的？我仅仅几个小时前才确认它真的存在。
6192355001501151 大地身躯上的伤口？
6192355000698361 不要问我他们怎么建成的。多面体的地基刺入小镇的地面长达数米，直至心脏。如同一根利箭的倒钩卡在了伤口上...\n你为什么脸色突然变得煞白？
6192355000698364 我知道这听起来很疯狂，但是地底下可能有原牛的血液，有很多。 
6192355000698363 我想你工作累坏了，甜心。
6192355000698367 在屠宰场他们以前会解剖一种特殊的公牛，把血液倒入地下，数世纪均如此。这是一种习俗。
6192355001503432 这里的泥土...很特别。血液可以被用来做万灵药。
6192355001503435 想象一下，小镇地下有个血液系统。通道和洞穴错综相连...就在这底下某处，流淌着血液。
6192355001503436 我们可以采集血液。但是这里不允许挖井，也没人允许我们地上钻个洞。日！等等...
6192355000698366 我明白了。说清楚。简明扼要——但是不要错过关键细节。讲重点。
6192355000698382 你打算拆除他？在这种情况下怎么找工人...
6192355000698380 我们有解决方案了一个我自己都有点得意的聪明办法。\n你没有救我的命，但是你确实帮我拯救了我的职业荣誉。 Intuition never fails me. But I'll need to get proof. Otherwise, they'll refuse to demolish that wretched edifice.
6192355001501153 这只是传说。都市传说。
6192355001501154 我们的土地很正常。
6192355001501152 是的，布拉克。大地的身躯。这里的土地很特别。等等，你不知道吗？
6192355001501156 我只是...没有足够的时间。
6192355001501157 你发现了什么？
6192355001501155 你们三个人在共同解决这个问题。你，丹考夫斯基, 和克拉拉 the amnesiac. Each is looking for their piece. I never fail in such matters. But forget it. I found out your part myself.
6192355001501159 我现在明白了。"All blood seeps from Olonngo…"
6192355001501160 该死...
6192355001503445 谁和你说这些的？
6192355001501158 Well, I've discovered your blood. It's underground.\nThere are caverns beneath the屠宰场. The blood of your ritual bulls was poured there. It doesn't rot. It's unclear why. It's abnormally vital—it even seeps to the surface sometimes.\nIs it true that it's forbidden to dig wells in this town?
6192355001501162 你现在计划做什么？
6192355001501161 Cheer up. If not for you, my thoughts wouldn't have gone that direction.\nIt won't bother me if you consider this a shared achievement.
6192355001501167 ...
6192355001501168 [...二十一...二十二...二十三...二十四]
6192355001501166 ...我明白了。现在请安静...二十五秒。我需要想想。
6192355001501170 ...血液会喷涌而出， killing the wounded.
6192355001501171 我还以为你会建议拆除屠宰场。
6192355001501172 你做决定真是快得离谱...
6192355001501169 地下有血液。多面体的地基刺穿了土地，就像利箭的倒钩埋在身体里。\n所以我们只需要把箭拔出来。
6192355001501174 So you're not afraid of children rioting…?
6192355001501175 似乎你痛恨塔，只是想找个理由搜查一下它。 
6192355001501173 No. The last thing I need is a riot.
6192355001501182 等等。你完全不理解！ You can't just bleed the Earth dry! 如果它是个活生生的生物，它会死的。
6192355001501181 没了？所以你在的计划中，我就打酱油了...
6192355001501183 Bayarlaa for the honor… basaghan.
6192355001501180 谢谢你，医生。你帮助我解开了一个谜团。 Nothing more is required of you.\nStandby until blood pours from the ground. 准备好制作你的药吧。
6192355001501188 I thought 审判官s were required to be open to belief in the impossible.
6192355001501189 You just don't care. Puzzle solved, right? To hell with everything else.
6192355001503449 I am. 我感觉真正的工作才刚刚开始...
6192355001501187 ...好好休息一下吧，医生。你绝对是工作太累了。做些其他事情， Or are you not busy enough as it is?
6192355001503400 什么意思？
6192355001503429 我知道这是个诗歌，但我不知道出处。我不能和你一起朗诵。
6192355001503399 "Proverbs are stories, just seen from a distance. Is this too much for you even to listen? Guess all you feel is seething indifference."
6192355001503402 这怎么可能？
6192355001503409 形而上学？你是认真的吗？
6192355001503401 又一次，我证明了第一直觉从没让我失望过。最初的假设几乎总是正确的。 That's exactly how things turned out to be… literally <i>and</i> metaphysically.
6192355001503404 既然你弄明白了，至少告诉我它是怎么浮在空中的。 at least tell me how it remains in the air.
6192355001503423 你想让我汇报什么？
6192355001503573 我没什么可汇报的，抱歉。
6192355001503403 学者帮我我弄清楚了。他和斯塔马丁兄弟，凯恩家...很多人对话过。I don't have time to give a full accounting.\nWe meet here for <i>you</i> to report to <i>me,</i> not vice versa. And I haven't had sufficient sleep for far too long. Even I have my limits.
6192355001503408 It must feel great to solve a riddle when you already know the answer.
6192355001503414 是的。第一次爆发发生在五年前。
6192355001592472 你昨天真的登上多面体了？
6192355001503407 ...我是正确的，当然。爆发的起因就是塔的建造。两次都是。这是沙疫第二次在小镇肆虐，对吧？ 
6192355001503411 该死...
6192355001503416 纯属巧合。
6192355001503410 塔是什么时候建造的？
6192355001503413 Eh.
6192355001503415 我是个外科医生，不是诊断学家。
6192355001503412 发现事实之间的关联对于任何调查者来说都是非常有用的技能，布拉克。And a surgeon often serves as one too, wouldn't you agree?
6192355001503418 你能证明吗？
6192355001503419 How exactly does it work?
6192355001503417 任何颠覆自然的行为都将会受到阻碍，这就是自然的 <i>本质</i>。Such is the matter you're made of, whether a person or a town.\nThey tried to subvert nature. It retaliated. The case is clear.
6192355001503425 哦。是的，当然，解药...我想我找到了。
6192355001503428 非常清晰。
6192355001503424 告诉我，阿泰米·布拉克。你身体好吗？你能够清晰思考吗？
6192355001503427 我知道这听起来很疯狂，但是地底下可能有血，有很多。 
6192355001503426 Then why exactly are we discussing doomed architecture?
6192355001503431 是的。
6192355001503430 冷静...我希望你不要突然心脏病发作。我只是打个比方。 Were you… speaking literally?
6192355001503439 疏散了？什么时候？
6192355001503440 What a lucky coincidence. Your doing, too?
6192355001503438 他们被疏散了。将军一开始就做了。\n对于该表扬的事，我从不会吝啬赞美——他是个伟人。特别对于一个军事指挥官而言。
6192355001503442 一个没有孩子的小镇...这就是你想要做的事吗？
6192355001503441 In the morning. And we aren't going to discuss it now.
6192355001503444 你为什么这么认为？
6192355001503443 奇怪。我认为大地是你的研究专长。我曾认为只有你才能解开这部分谜团。  
6192355001503447 我帮着照顾生者！
6192355001503448 你现在有什么计划？
6192355001503446 Not you.
6192355001506851 Then let's get back to the prose.
6192355001503450 你当然不知道。对你而言，它还没有被书写。
6192355001506853 当然...每个人都在审判官的计划中扮演角色，对吗？
6192355001506854 但是孩子们在里面！
6192355001506852 火炮，布拉克。军队。他们的任务就是——在小镇里射击。所以让他们射掉里面最没用的部分。
6192355001506856 一个没有孩子的小镇...这就是你想要做的事吗？
6192355001506855 他们被疏散了。将军一开始就做了。\n对于该表扬的事，我从不会吝啬赞美——他是个伟人。特别对于一个军事指挥官而言。
6192355001592474 你应该找一天登上去看看。上面的天空非常特别。 
6192355001592475 If I say yes, would you draw one up?
6192355001592477 这座塔和第一次爆发有什么关系？
6192355001592473 No. I studied its base. Collected information. Interrogated people.\nWould you like a written report?
6192355000813058 孩子们似乎认为这是一座生命之塔。
6192355001506871 Wow. How did I manage that?
6192355000813056 我有证据我需要摧毁这座死亡之塔。 This is a goodbye, then, 阿泰米 布拉克. \n在过去的几天里，你对我而言，真的变得...很重要。也许你就是我关心的人。
6192355000813060 你似乎对那座建筑抱有私仇。
6192355000813059 Children also throw bullets into fires and believe in the tooth fairy.
6192355000813064 Why are you so desperate?
6192355001506872 你怎么突然变得这么真诚起来了？
6192355000813063 是的。摧毁它将是我毕生的工作。\nI can say it safely, now.因为我将不久于世。
6192355000813067 被谁？
6192355000813068 你是怎么知道的？
6192355000813066 今天我会被杀。
6192355000813070 什么原因？
6192355000813069 你可以称之为预感。
6192355000813072 那你需要逃走。
6192355000813071 军队从来不会错过对审判官开枪的机会。我们一直胜过他们一筹。  They pay us back in kind.\nI know they have the order. They must. This isn't my first year on the job.
6192355000813074 那就把它们递送过去！三个人应该足够了。 
6192355000813075 把纸给我。我把它们送到城镇大厅.
6192355001506949 Flee…in what transport? Speaking of, how did you get here in the first place? It's not like you flew in on a broom, surely.
6192355000813073 我考虑过了。 Send a courier in my place… or better yet, three. But no. 可能会有懦夫。
6192355000813077 不。
6192355000813076 但是你会立即被逮捕。你能承受这个代价吗？ 
6192355000813082 你知道我是怎么想的吗？让这一切见鬼吧。我们一起逃走吧。 
6192355000813081 So be it, then.
6192355000813080 You've made your choice, then.\nYou are right. Fleeing would be a coward's choice. You cannot afford it, so neither can I.
6192355000813089 到时见。
6192355000813090 好。
6192355000813088 Good… Yes. It's the right thing to do. Right.\nA train will wait for us by the Passenger Station at two in the morning. I will meet you there.
6192355001506874 Emshen. 知晓准则之人。
6192355001506950 Yargachin.
6192355001507351 People call us by different names… Depends if the treatment worked.
6192355001506873 I deeply respect open-minded people, unconstrained by whatever is imposed upon them. Capable of finding less obvious connections.\nIt's a skill poets have… and steppe surgeons, it seems. What's the word…?
6192355001506918 好吧，我拿定主意了。让我们逆天改命，我们一起远走高飞吧。
6192355001506944 不，阿格莱雅·莉莉奇。我也许是奴隶，或许是某人的木偶。但我绝对不会抛弃他们。
6192355001506945 父亲的职责就是我的职责。I can't. Even if it's all over, even if they're dead or doomed, what else could I do?
6192355001506917 To hell with the Tower. An hour ago, I wished to settle the score with those who sent me here, irreversibly stifling my life. Now, I don't care.\nSomething unique occurred during our conversation. Something so important I'm comfortable changing my plans. \nIt's happening to you, too. Don't deny it.
6192355001506920 You've become special to me, too.
6192355001506929 We live in a large country. Lots of places to lie low for a bit. With a mind like yours, creating a new life will be simple.
6192355001506930 Try, at least! Better than walking meekly to your execution!
6192355001506919 Fleeing… What's the point? What is there for me to flee to?
6192355001506922 I have a duty… to those people who have also become special to me.
6192355001506931 你为什么要我？
6192355001506935 我同意。
6192355001506939 毫无疑问。
6192355001506921 ...你再次倾覆了我的世界，阿泰米·布拉克。 A self-taught, backwoods surgeon…\nFine. 我会让三个信使带文件送去司令部，而我今晚就离开小镇。我还有这个选择的余地，但是你必须和我一起走。
6192355001506924 Is it, now?
6192355001506923 You don't have a duty! You came here to conquer fate. This is how it's done.
6192355001506926 那孩子们怎么办？
6192355001506940 Who <i>are</i> those people behind the scenes? The ones pulling our strings, or whatever?
6192355001506925 Do you know why I marked you among many others? You gave me the key. You showed me that people can simply disregard those who pull their strings, those who set your path for you.\nThey tell you what victory is. But it's a lie. It rings false. True victory is breaking through the walls, changing the rules of the game. \nCome on. Make up your mind.
6192355001506928 那塔怎么办？如果你的信使没能成功递送这些文件呢？ The Town is in chaos…
6192355001506927 醒醒，布拉克。没有孩子。这些都不是真的。
6192355001506933 老天爷...
6192355001506934 阿格莱雅·莉莉奇, commissar of the omnipotent Powers That Be, and 阿泰米 布拉克, a scab shed from the body of a godforsaken people. A brilliant couple.
6192355001506932 因为我可以感觉到，我们需要彼此。\n从来没有两人像我们这样判若云泥。 We could have an interesting life together. I can see it. You can see it, with your heart, in the Lines…
6192355001506937 I want to abandon the tracks laid down for me. Now's the time to do it. Those are the Lines I see.
6192355001506936 Huh. I didn't expect you'd agree.
6192355001506942 但是我需要照顾孩子们...
6192355001506943 Seriously? You're fine with leaving before you watch the Polyhedron fall, no matter how much you loathe it?
6192355001506941 The ones who suggested this question to you, who fed you this thought. \nIf you agree to leave with me, I'll explain while we t拉薇尔. It will be a long and difficult conversation.
6192355001506947 No. If I doom everything by doing this, so be it. But I can't abandon them… My conscience is more important to me.
6192355001506948 A spiderweb… I see. So that's what the whole "making connections" thing was about… and I was like a spider. Fine. Let's leave the Town.
6192355001506946 You'll be enslaved to the words inside your head, to the story made before you. Not even made for you, but for someone else. What for?\nEven that girl 克拉拉 knows the more we twist in the spider's web, the worse we make it… for ourselves <i>and</i> others.
6192355001507353 What's wrong?
6192355001507352 Well… let us part as friends. For the first time, I say this to someone I wanted to create patterns with.
6192355001507452 Flee. On a broom, or on foot, but however you do it, flee.
6192355001507453 这是审判官的技能。 Ending the game—not in stalemate or checkmate, but by simply getting up from the table. I'd love to do the same, if I could.
6192355001507451 Not on a broom, no. Don't ask unnecessary questions.
6192355000745254 我不是，事实上。
6192355000745257 你错了。我们属于两个完全不同的世界。 
6192355000813091 你也是。
6192355000745253 我很高兴我能遇到你，布拉克。你是一个非常特别的人。
6192355000813093 It's hard to grow.
6192355000813094 I'm a brute, and not a clever one at that.
6192355000813092 No. You're a full-fledged human being.\nWe are taught that humans are processes. Nearly half will halt this process at a very early stage. Another half will even regress after growing up, shedding what little progress they made in childhood.
6192355000813096 Very well. I'll take your word for it.
6192355000813097 告诉我有关你的工作。
6192355000813095 这件事上你可以相信我，布拉克。\n我敢说你会成为一个出色的审判官, but… no. You wouldn't, actually. Your tools are different. You don't use our mode of analysis, but you still see the big picture. Connecting the dots is the foundation of our work.
6192355000813099 是的。准则。
6192355000813100 听起来...很熟悉。
6192355000813098 我长话短说。\nYou build out a map of facts, and conclusions, then snap a picture of them. Keeping in mind that facts, too, are processes; they change over time. Then you tease out connections from one to the other…
6192355001506862 Finally you ask a question you don't already know the answer to.
6192355000813101 Perhaps a great bull, Bos Turokh, came to bid us farewell. They do that. I had a dream where one derailed my train… An eternity ago, now.
6192355000745256 呆在这儿。我出去检查一下情况。
6192355000745255 我们为什么停下来了？
6192355000814953 我很高兴你能等我。
6192355000814954 那么你不再是审判官了...
6192355000814952 我很高兴你能来。
6192355000814957 如你所愿。
6192355000814956 好。进车厢吧，我会跟你进去的。
6192355001506864 我已无所畏惧。
6192355001506865 It's not about trust. I simply realized nothing was holding me back there anymore. I've done all I could.
6192355001506863 Ask no questions. Trust me.
6192355001506867 And I'm no longer yargachin, or emshen, or… whoever else. I'm leaving my fate behind.
6192355001506866 是的，我不再是了。
6192355001506869 所以你现在脱离危险了？
6192355001506870 Actually… where did this train come from?
6192355001506868 We both did. I believe it is right. We'll make our own path from now on.\nThis is the ultimate freedom, I think: departing from the track someone has laid for you.
6192355000831889 What have you done to him?
6192355000831888 Yes?
6192355000831891 He's all messed up!
6192355000831894 Does he bother you?
6192355000831890 我？我什么都没做。
6192355000831893 What was he babbling about puppets? Did you tell him about that?
6192355000831909 放他走。
6192355000831892 I have a unique approach to each person. Can't you see the man is thinking? Changing? Leave him be.
6192355000831896 Did you interrogate him?
6192355000831908 I think you… damaged him, somehow.
6192355000831895 No.
6192355000831898 ...真的？
6192355000831897 No. He figured that out on his own.
6192355000831900 Why is that?
6192355000831903 Am I different, somehow?
6192355000831899 It's true for him. I don't know about <i>you.</i>
6192355001592033 I'm not free, I'm confused. And unsure what to do.
6192355000831902 I don't believe in gods.
6192355001594793 Thanks, I guess.
6192355000831901 You are unlike anyone I have ever seen. Freer than other men. As though your strings are pulled by some manner of god.
6192355000831911 Well… no. In his condition, I'd rather he stayed put.
6192355000831910 你这么认为？
6192355000831913 你让他相信他只是个玩具。 To what end?
6192355000831912 Precisely.
6192355000831915 You didn't mention me.
6192355000831914 我们都是。他是个玩具，我是个玩具。你不知道吗？
6192355001592017 你不打算给我下令了？
6192355001592031 我取得了一些进展。
6192355001592452 I'm not saying anything.
6192355001592016 洗耳恭听。
6192355001592028 你是一个审判官。你比我更清楚。也许你已经找到了一丝线索。
6192355001592032 我可没那么说。
6192355001592018 No, doctor. \nAre you a courier? An aide? An assistant? A secretary? Or else did you assume I'd point you to one location with all the answers, and all you'd have to do is stroll over there?
6192355001592021 哦...但你告诉我每天向你汇报工作。
6192355001592050 我取得了一些进展
6192355001592020 我今天不需要你，医生。
6192355001592023 没注意到。
6192355001592026 What…from here?
6192355001592022 我现在要和其他人交谈？你没注意到吗?他就在拐角。
6192355001592025 也许你可以给我些建议？
6192355001592027 我取得了一些进展。
6192355001592451 还没有。
6192355001592024 Or do you have something to report? Have you made any progress in your search?
6192355001592030 屠宰场就是交集所在，但是我不知道怎么进去。
6192355001592034 我们是在解决同一个问题吗，我想？
6192355001592036 我会试试。
6192355001592029 Those who can only follow crosses on a map have already received my orders. They're of no interest to me. And they won't solve our problem.\nI'm relying on those who can think for themselves. Don't disappoint me.
6192355001592039 傲云，屠宰场的工头，从大草原回来了。他可能知道点什么。 
6192355001592040 我想我要调查一下屠宰场...
6192355001592038 Report.
6192355001592042 我需要去一趟屠宰场。我一直想去一趟。
6192355001592041 你的傲云一无所知。He tried to find those… brontosauruses of yours in the steppe, only to learn they're extinct. Any more bright ideas?
6192355001592044 瞎蒙一气。
6192355001592045 我信任傲云。他答应我找出....
6192355001592043 你知道你在寻找什么吗？还是说只是瞎蒙一气？
6192355001592047 那告诉我应该做什么。
6192355001592048 我知道。
6192355001592046 我们已经没时间碰运气了，布拉克! 完全没有！
6192355000557351 阿格莱雅·莉莉奇
6192355001271551 阿格莱雅·莉莉奇
6192355000378985 啥事？
6192355000378986 找错人了。
6192355000378984 阿泰米·布拉克?
6192355000378988 <i>我</i>要为这里发生的一切负责？
6192355000378989 立即？听起来可不像是个邀请，更像是审讯通知书。
6192355001411623 你还不够努力。把国家审判官的印章盖在你的额头上怎么样？<i>那样<i>看上去会正式一些。
6192355000378987 阿格莱雅·莉莉奇，国家审判官和紧急情况政治委员，已经来到了这个小镇。她选择大教堂作为她的办公地点。\n作为对现在状况负责的人，你被邀请与之会面，立即。
6192355000378991 我不喜欢这样...
6192355000378992 好吧。我这就走。
6192355000378993 病人才是我的头等大事，审判官也得靠边站。 
6192355000378990 或许。
6192355000378995 大声吼叫的奶牛产奶最少。
6192355000378998 If that's so, there must be a line all the way to her office, with or without me.
6192355000378994 阿泰米·布拉克，没人在乎你想要的什么。审判官计划一天解决当下的危机。 
6192355000378997 把口水擦干净，好吗？或者审判官 任命你为她的私人马屁精？
6192355000378999 Got it.
6192355000379000 I guess I might as well take a look at this miracle.
6192355000378996 No… what was the name, 布拉克? She's no <i>cow.</i> She's a wolf. Got it?

6192355000397252 What do you care?
6192355000397253 I am.
6192355000397254 I haven't got time to be sad.
6192355000397251 Are you sad?
6192355000397256 If you never had parents, then you don't.
6192355000397257 I don't need your sympathy.
6192355000397258 What do you want from me?
6192355000397255 I just wanted you to know: I sympathize. I've never had parents. I've never had anyone… So I know how terribly awful it must feel right now.
6192355000397260 It's fine. I don't hold a grudge.
6192355000397261 Get lost.
6192355000397262 你想要什么？
6192355000397259 I'm sorry I said mean things to you. That's why you think I'm evil, isn't it? But it was the truth.
6192355000397264 You're lying.
6192355000397265 Are you messing with me again?
6192355000397266 She is…?
6192355000397263 I just wanted you to know that the girl from the cemetery—格蕾丝—is talking to your 父亲 right this moment. And I think it strains her a great deal.
6192355000397268 This can't be true.
6192355000397269 No, you don't.
6192355000397270 Right this moment, you say?
6192355000397267 They're speaking. And I think it's killing her… Could you tell her to stop? Please? I think she might listen to you. I feel sorry for her—do you understand?
6192355000397272 I don't believe you.
6192355000397273 And he's responding?
6192355000397271 Right this moment.
6192355000397275 Get lost.
6192355000397276 Is she sitting by his grave or something?
6192355000397274 Yes, it can.
6192355000397278 Fine. I'll take a look. But if it turns out you lied to me…
6192355000397279 You deranged lunatic…
6192355000397277 Why won't you believe I'm a good person, 布拉克?! Open your eyes! I speak the truth! Remember, I'm always speaking the truth!

6192355000406177 I like it here better.
6192355000406175 Why linger? Don't get sidetracked. You have a duty. You have the list. Go back.
6192355000406179 Watch what?
6192355000406180 You don't have to. Go home.
6192355000406178 We're watching. Observing. No time for games, now. We must watch.
6192355000406182 No one's going anywhere.
6192355000406183 Relax. I'll go first.
6192355000406181 Which of them will enter the door first? I think it will be the older girl. Not the boy in a collar.

6192355000425355 Of course it's abandoned. Those thugs wouldn't be here otherwise.
6192355000425353 Look 'round, 布拉克, at this abandoned house.
6192355000436052 I've got nothing I need. Neither food, nor water, nor clothes.
6192355000436053 I'm managing, for now.
6192355000436051 Have you secured all you need to survive?
6192355000436055 So you say I should burgle this place?
6192355000436056 You mean to say I could pin the blame on those two. Right?
6192355000436054 I hardly urge that you mimic those two. But times are dire; and what you need, you may find lurking in empty houses such as these.\nAnd if the owners should return abruptly… You were neither first nor last criminal here.
6192355000436058 Quite so. A doctor, not a burglar.
6192355000436059 So you're like my inner voice, huh? And it's not my conscience speaking.
6192355000436060 Fair enough.
6192355000436057 Exactly. 'tis your life at stake; and things are merely things, that you might then repay. You are, indeed, a doctor here, 布拉克.

6192355000465462 Who?
6192355000465656 Was she… buried?
6192355000465461 Finally, someone! So I was right to wait here… Maybe you, at least, know where she was buried?
6192355000465658 …She was buried? By whom?
6192355000465664 When did you last see her?
6192355000465657 穆克.
6192355000465660 I don't.
6192355000465665 So there is still hope?
6192355000465659 They put her six feet under, but no one knows where. 卡佩拉 can't see anything… We thought that if she can't see it, then maybe 穆克 is still alive somewhere. You don't know, either?
6192355000465662 I can't bring the dead back.
6192355000465663 …I see.
6192355000465661 …She loved you, you know. 穆克, I mean. She was overjoyed to find you. All she wanted in the world was to bring her parents back, little weirdo. She believed it might somehow happen—through you.
6192355001599578 I don't.
6192355001599577 They put her six feet under, but no one knows where. You don't know, either?
6192355000472251 Friend
6192355000466152 What carrier?
6192355000466153 They also say you shouldn't waste breath on idle chatter.
6192355000466151 They say the 萨普洛夫s nurture the plague. That they harbor a carrier. A girl.
6192355000466155 Why would they do that?
6192355000466156 And what will you do with her if he does give her up?
6192355000466154 Hell if I know… That's why we're here, to get him to give her up, but he won't. Keeps lying, saying there's no carrier, trying to talk us down. Soon he's gonna cause people to hunt down women in the street, like on that first day.
6192355000466158 Nonsense. He's not like that.
6192355000466159 Who knows, maybe you're right.
6192355000466157 Are you dense, pal? The plague plays right into 萨普洛夫's hands. The 凯恩s and 奥吉姆斯基 have always resented him, but now he wields power. \nHe's pulling out all the stops. <i>Promoting order,</i> he says. Some order!
6192355000466161 If they do find a carrier, 萨普洛夫 won't need your help to deal with them.
6192355000466162 Eager to kill, aren't you?
6192355000466160 Only one thing to do. Put her back where she came from. Into the earth.
6192355000466164 Perhaps. I haven't seen.
6192355000466165 Listen to me, idiots. There is no carrier! It's all nonsense and idle talk.
6192355000466166 Listen carefully, and tell everyone. Even if there is a carrier, that carrier is our salvation.
6192355000466163 Well, healer, will you tell us about the carrier? Is she in there? With him?
6192355000466168 We'll make a cure from that person's blood. A vaccine. We need the carrier alive for that.
6192355000466169 Nothing for you to question me about. Just do what I tell you and you'll live.
6192355000466167 What does that mean?
6192355000466171 I always tell the truth.
6192355000466172 No. I'm kidding.
6192355000466173 Listen to me: no mob justice! Not one girl gets hurt. Do you understand me?
6192355000466170 Is this true, healer?
6192355000466175 What?
6192355000466176 I do. But we need to make sure, and that's not your job.
6192355000466177 According to my data, everyone dies. No one's survived.
6192355000466174 They also say she's not alone. Not everyone dies from this sickness! Do you get what that means?
6192355000466179 "If."
6192355000466180 That's none of your concern. Go on home now.
6192355000466181 What do you know about connections? That's not how any of this works, you fool!
6192355000466178 If there are people who get sick but don't die, the plague must come from them!

6192355000466352 你是谁 talking about, ma'am?
6192355000466353 Your 维多利亚 could do nothing about a plague like this.
6192355000466354 I remember 妮娜. After her, a plague feels like little more than a funhouse.
6192355000466351 She's shown her true colors, the false Mistress. If our beloved white swan 维多利亚 were here, she'd be out on the street, shielding people from trouble.\nAnd 妮娜… if she were around, none of this would be happening. That's the sort of power <i>she</i> had.\nBut this one just locks herself up at home… A useless Mistress.
6192355000466356 You speak of Mistresses as if they work miracles. They're just women.
6192355000466355 You say 维多利亚… couldn't? You're just faithless! She would! She used to shelter the Town under her bright wings! She used to be our white mother! She would let no trouble in.\nWhat do you even know? Where did you even come from?
6192355000466358 Nonsense. What poison?
6192355000466359 Sorry. I feel sorry for us all.
6192355000466357 That 萨普洛夫 woman, 卡特琳娜. She's never had power. Utterly barren. We used to pity her, but now she's worse than barren—she sows poison.
6192355000466361 "This one"?
6192355000466362 A fine excuse. So you like power, then?
6192355000466360 So she was a woman of character. So what? They're all like that. Why ask more of her? And what power she had! She radiated heat, like a blazing forest fire. This one doesn't even give off light.
6192355000466364 I suppose I should be going.
6192355000466365 No. I don't understand.
6192355000466363 You know nothing, you dolt. If you don't know the power of the Mistresses, then shut your mouth and show some respect.\nHave some sense. Some give off heat, some give off light, some give off poison. We sense that she gives off poison.

6192355000466370 What does this have to do with 亚历山大 萨普洛夫? Are you not his reflection?
6192355000466367 Yes. You betrayed that person's expectations.
6192355000466368 No. Not unless you did intend to deceive them.
6192355000466369 First, we must find the truth. Then the falsehood. Then learn to pick them apart. Only after that can we answer such a question.
6192355000466366 If a person comes to think that you wounded their heart with deceit, does that mean that you truly are guilty of it? Moreso in regards to their feelings, their hopes, and their fears?
6192355000466372 Then: Yes, I suppose.
6192355000466373 Then: No.
6192355000466374 Then: This is a trick question, I shall not answer.
6192355000466375 Then: I forgot what the question was. Probably means it was a threatening sort of question.
6192355000466371 What indeed. I just asked you a question.
6192355000466377 They were the bones.
6192355000466378 They were the hands.
6192355000466379 They were the nerves.
6192355000466376 Our town's always had three ruling houses: 凯恩, 奥吉姆斯基, 萨普洛夫! Each one would reign o'er their own domain. The 凯恩s were our head; the 奥吉姆斯基 our belly. But pray, 布拉克, tell me what the 萨普洛夫s held.
6192355000466381 Wasn't there?
6192355000466382 I guess the genocide that the 奥吉姆斯基 were perpetrating against the Kin doesn't count as "crime."
6192355000466383 The 凯恩s are proud to call themselves criminals, though. I always remembered that.
6192355000466380 The 凯恩s were weavers of laws and of dreams; the 奥吉姆斯基 were masters of money and men. To 萨普洛夫 remained an executive power: Their task was to keep the streets in order, in a town where there was almost no crime.
6192355000466385 Veto power, maybe?
6192355000466386 It entails exactly what is happening now. They could seize control in face of a mortal crisis.
6192355000466387 I won't ask you what it meant, then.
6192355000466384 'Tis funny, you see. When the Houses agreed to manage the Town, 萨普洛夫 was in name the triumvirate's head.\nI know not what that meant, nor what it entailed.
6192355000466389 Stain the hands, too.
6192355000466390 Thank you, Reflection. I will keep this in mind.
6192355000466391 Ah, yes. The favorite excuse of vicious tyrants everywhere.
6192355000466388 萨普洛夫 still believes that his mission is clear: Keep order! He may not look the part, but he is not a fool. He knows duty entails the pursuit of order through fear, and that violent means stain the soul of a duty-bound man.
6192355000466393 Can't say. People seem to respect <i>me.</i>
6192355000466394 Nonsense. The world is full of opportunities for greatness.
6192355000466392 When denied respect, is a man not wounded, 布拉克? Not even for evil he does, but for failing to do much at all. Even more when you had not a chance to do any deed of note. There are only so many of those going 'round.
6192355000466396 To live a year of your life without doing something contemptible is already an outstanding feat. One I've never seemed to quite accomplish…
6192355000466397 What I'm doing now will be enough for the rest of my life.
6192355000466395 Perhaps it is now. But not in ordinary times.
6192355000466399 What are you getting at, Reflection?
6192355000466400 Indeed, I see where 萨普洛夫's pain comes from.
6192355000466401 Respect is a crutch for those without better things to care about.
6192355000466398 I speak not of you, 布拉克, I speak of my master!\nHis pride, his soul, has been wounded by lack of respect. He needs his authority, now more than ever. The 凯恩s, the 奥吉姆斯基, never trusted our House. Perhaps this distrust never turned to contempt. But distrust it was, dear sir.
6192355000466403 I am concerned with a different kind of pain.
6192355000466404 You think correctly.
6192355000466402 Nothing. I've said my peace. You're a healer; one thinks you might care to learn more about pain.
6192355000466955 亚历山大's Reflection
6192355000466406 Mistresses were two extraordinary women in the Town's ruling families. There was something undeniably uncanny about them.
6192355000466407 It's not a matter of belief. They're not goddesses.
6192355000466408 Who do you think the Mistresses are, then?
6192355000466405 The wisest women in our town would take the title "Mistress."\nA word that calls to mind the tales of ancient sorcery. Do you believe in such a thing?
6192355000466410 Nature is everywhere. Everything lives by her flows.
6192355000466411 Such "flows" are simple enough. Heat is their nature.
6192355000466409 Steppe-son, you bear the marks of nature's flow upon your skin; but mind how thin the twyre runs in your veins. You are more stone than Earth.\nLike ships must catch the wind in sails, our Town relies on Nature's flow.
6192355000466413 Such gifts are not yet the domain of mankind.
6192355000466414 We lost that gift when we learned to make tools.
6192355000466412 None know how many winding paths there are; none know what forces run their course. There are no words for what they hold; to see them calls for gifted senses, gifted minds. And should one hear the call of such a gift: What feats, what brave new world, they'd find with it! Like being the very first to hoist a sail.
6192355000466416 Women can sense these things.
6192355000466417 And?
6192355000466415 维多利亚 奥吉姆斯卡娅 and 妮娜 凯恩娜: One five-foot-six, one six-foot-one; mortals. But seen as giants! For they could feel the Powers move across the firmament…
6192355000466419 And that's it?
6192355000466418 Some merely know the flows. Some feel them, now and then. A mistress tastes those waves, might drink of them. And when the stars align, might ride them. The people felt such women knew the workings of the world itself…
6192355000466421 I've heard that 维多利亚 did raise the dead. But that's probably just a rumor.
6192355000466422 Clearly they didn't bolt those doors tightly enough.
6192355000466423 Yes, I knew a man like that. Nobody knew how, but his presence would severely change the… pressure. Every time.
6192355000466420 How is that not enough? The mistresses kept their hands quite clean of rough and tawdry magics. 维多利亚 knew not a spell that brought the dead to life. But 妮娜 did inspire fear. Along her steps, doors shut and children hid! But those two women gave the Town its life. None know the hows or whys of such a power.
6192355000466425 The Bright and the Fearsome, as they were called.
6192355000466426 The Dark and the Warm. Right, I recall.
6192355000466427 Taste and Laughter.
6192355000466424 Two Mistresses there were, and all felt that to be correct. For one was Night and one was Day; one was Heat and one was Cold; one was Storm, and one was Calm. Contrast reigned.\n妮娜 held court over schism and unease; 维多利亚's domain was peace and nourishment.
6192355000466429 …妮娜, the Wicked.
6192355000466430 …妮娜, the Wild.
6192355000466431 …妮娜, the Nocturnal.
6192355000466428 The 凯恩s had 妮娜; the 奥吉姆斯基 had 维多利亚. When 萨普洛夫 returned with his young bride, my 卡特琳娜, there was no place for her in such a scheme.\nBut her hairs would raise, and her skin would sense it. And once 妮娜 did perish, 卡特琳娜 took her place and seized a name for herself…
6192355000466433 And nobody really noticed.
6192355000466434 Luckily, she never became a second 妮娜.
6192355000466432 妮娜 did only drive men to fear. But 卡特琳娜, naive as she was, mistook the nuance of 妮娜's role for a romantic darkness. And that in turn would drive her down the road to frightful things.
6192355000466436 Yes, I remember those days.
6192355000466437 Perhaps our town would have been like that without her. It's not like anyone can check.
6192355000466435 And is that such a blessing, sir? 妮娜 did not just take children from their mothers.\nShe tinged our lives with color. Recall how in her days to walk the streets was an adventure.
6192355000466439 True, it is easier to be fearsome than kind.
6192355000466440 She should have stayed out of those games.
6192355000466441 She took our… strange customs too seriously.
6192355000466438 维多利亚 died, and 卡特琳娜 replaced both Mistresses. Two roles to play; she grew into neither.\nBut patient folk would wait for her to find her gift. And some may still await her day.
6192355000466443 Is she afraid?
6192355000466444 Is she in pain?
6192355000466445 Is she ashamed?
6192355000466442 Wild 妮娜 begat 玛利亚, the talented. Warm 维多利亚 begat 卡佩拉, the gifted.\nMy Mistress has no one… She'd take any child, to raise as her kin, gift or no gift.
6192355000466447 There, there… No need to cry.
6192355000466448 Don't whine, Reflection.
6192355000466446 She sits in darkness, weaving blackest yarn from heaviest thoughts.\nShe'd rather knit baby socks…\nInstead, she drapes black folds around her throat and chokes.
6192355000466450 I could prescribe something for her nerves.
6192355000466451 A grown woman, still playing at being a sorceress!
6192355000466452 She'll manage. Probably. There's definitely still time for her to have a child.
6192355000466449 At night we hear her talk to herself, mad: I failed to give life to the Town, talentless! I failed to nourish town or child, giftless! I failed to guard against plague, useless! I am barren!
6192355000466454 I'm happy for your mistress, Reflection.
6192355000466455 So where is this girl?
6192355000466456 She's pregnant?
6192355000466453 But have you heard? Such wondrous news! We wait, in awe, for our new daughter, true and talented!\nAnd such a talent, sir! A blessed gift! And now we are not two but three; and one will much more mighty than two be.
6192355000466458 Can I see her?
6192355000466459 Yes, it's for the best.
6192355000466457 The daughter's adopted, and near grown up. It is for the best; we wait too long, and now, and orphan child will have a home at last.
6192355000466461 Your mistress has gone mad, Reflection.
6192355000466462 I've met that girl. She does indeed carry a long list of chores…
6192355000466463 What is this gift? Is that even important right now?
6192355000466460 She walks the streets, and does her chores… Bound to this plague, somehow. She has the gift, so she must stay to stop the plague. Salvation can and must come from the House of 萨普洛夫.
6192355000466954 卡特琳娜's Reflection
6192355000466494 I wonder what you did to your old ones.
6192355000466495 There was someone gullible enough to adopt you?
6192355000466496 "Strike, if you will, but hear"? Picked up some Latin from 丹考夫斯基?
6192355000466493 Wait! Strike, if you will, but hear me. I came to entrust the lives of my new parents to you.
6192355000466498 No need. I know it.
6192355000466499 You can distinguish Greek from Latin? I'm impressed.
6192355000466497 Actually, it's Greek. Want me to give you the context?
6192355000466501 I didn't know.
6192355000466502 Right, that's what I figured.
6192355000466500 What? Why would you say that? I never even knew them. I've been an orphan for as long as I can remember.
6192355000466504 Are they sick?
6192355000466505 I pity them.
6192355000466503 There was.
6192355000466507 If no one's dearer to you, watch over them yourself.
6192355000466508 Wait a second. Don't I ruin everything I touch? Isn't that what you told me?
6192355000466506 There's trouble looming over both of them. Something with their house. It's a house of troubles. My adopted mother is especially in danger. Can you help us? Can you watch over them? Please.
6192355000466510 Why don't you help them yourself? Aren't you supposed to be the greatest healer in the world?
6192355000466511 I forgive you. But I want answers.
6192355000466509 Forgive me. Please forgive me. Please.
6192355000466513 Fine. Who are they?
6192355000466514 Tell them to come to me.
6192355000466515 A warm heart and a cool head. I can tell that something's off. I'm saying no.
6192355000466512 I… I did take care of them. But I can't any longer. I need to disappear for a while. Maybe even forever.\nDon't ask… Please. You'll understand soon enough. But tell me you'll do it, 布拉克! I know you have a warm heart!
6192355000466517 You're a good fit for each other.
6192355000466518 The 萨普洛夫s… A house of troubles. I see.
6192355000466516 The 萨普洛夫s. They're my new mother and 父亲.
6192355000466520 They're bedridden?
6192355000466521 Don't know about what?
6192355000466519 They can't. They won't. They don't know.
6192355000466523 I'll do it. Be on your way now. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355000466524 I'll pay her a visit, but I can't promise I'll save her.
6192355000466525 No. Watch over those bloodsuckers yourself.
6192355000466522 Will you do it? They'll never ask anyone themselves! Mother thinks the whole Town hates her for failing to protect them from the plague! \nAnd 父亲… He takes all evil on himself, so that no one else will be soiled. But mother has the worst of it. She needs a doctor…
6192355000466527 Not yet.
6192355000466528 They care for one another. But what about you? Why aren't you taking care of them?
6192355000466529 萨普洛夫 is in trouble. People are unhappy with him—because of you.
6192355000466526 So... have you seen my parents? How are they doing?
6192355000466531 Is it true that you're immune to the plague?
6192355000466532 They think you're a carrier. Is it true?
6192355000466530 What...? People harass them? Because of me? Oh, but what do they want... why can't they just leave me alone!
6192355000466534 Phew. You got me there for a moment.
6192355000466535 People believe that there is an urchin girl that the disease doesn't take for some reason. Do you know of many other suspects?
6192355000466533 Oh my God, sweet God in heavens, obviously, seriously, definitely, clearly I'm not!
6192355000466537 Really?
6192355000466538 Many people think you're a saint. But there's something uncanny about you.
6192355001652999 You're not the only salvation.
6192355000466536 Uh, a ton! There are lots of urchin girls around, especially these days.\nBut no matter how many there are, those rumors are utter drivel! Sand pest kills everyone it touches. There's no salvation... unless I help.
6192355000466540 You're scaring me, 克拉拉. And not just me.
6192355000466541 Help—by putting them out of their misery, huh?
6192355000466539 Fools! Utter fools! They all think I'm connected to the plague because... because... I don't know why! Guess it's because I'm always first wherever calamity strikes. But that's because I rush to help...
6192355000466543 Why would you make them look suspicious?
6192355000466544 You already have.
6192355000466542 I can't. I can't go there. I don't want to make them look suspicious...
6192355000466546 You're connected to this plague. Aren't you, 克拉拉?
6192355000466547 I suspect you're patient zero, as the 学者 would have put it.
6192355000466545 Forget it.
6192355000466549 I know!
6192355000466550 They're wealthy. They live in a sturdy house. Others need my help more.
6192355000466548 Then go, please! Before it's too late!
6192355000466652 Fine. I believe you.
6192355000466653 No. I don't trust you.
6192355000466654 All kinds of things exist...
6192355000466651 I'm a good person, 布拉克. You can tell lies from truth, don't you? Then you know I'm not lying! I'm a good person.\nAnd if anyone tells you I'm a shapeshifter... those are just rumors. Shapeshifters don't exist!
6192355000466958 克拉拉
6192355000467053 I'm not asking around about her.
6192355000467054 Not really.
6192355000467055 Friends? Sure.
6192355000467052 My friend told me to tell you this: Why are you asking around about her? Do you want to make friends with her?
6192355000467057 Things will grow there, actually.
6192355000467058 That fellow in the rat costume, is he a friend of yours?
6192355000467059 Were you eavesdropping by the window?
6192355000467056 My friend told me to tell you: You can't touch the ones who live in the earth! Also, you can't hurt the earth. If you cut it open or cure it, or something like that, things won't grow there anymore.\nSee? My friend's good.
6192355000467061 Plenty of wonderful critters live in the earth.
6192355000467062 Yeah. You know what else lives in the earth? Corpses.
6192355000467063 Hooves <i>and</i> boots? Make up your mind.
6192355000467060 Well, I just told you everything in general. Also, there's a wonderful worm living in the earth. It has two blue spots on its belly and tiny boots on its tiny feet with tiny hooves.
6192355000467065 Forget it. I'm just seeing things.
6192355000467066 It won't look good on you.
6192355000467064 A rat costume? Ooh, can I have a rat costume too?
6192355000467051 穆克

6192355000500208 
6192355001711351 Odongh
6192355001134061 你想要什么？
6192355001134062 Shut up. And put this away!
6192355001134060 …Scared? I'm just estimating how they're gonna look. Don't you worry, for now… For now, they're still right as rain. But the countdown has started, so to speak.\nThey're the most <i>delicious</i> piece to me… The most interesting morsels.
6192355001134064 Just get lost.
6192355001134065 你是谁？
6192355001134063 Oh, I'm more about putting things <i>under</i>. So, sorry if I can't oblige… Will you forgive me? Oh, pretty, pretty please?
6192355001134067 They're from a list I got from my 父亲. I won't let you have them.
6192355001134068 Where's the Eighth?
6192355001134066 I only want to play hide-and-seek. I am, after all, playing with you all. Hide-and-seek, tag. Dice. Tic-tac-toe. Love my x's and o's… So keep in mind: Ready or not, here I come.
6192355001134070 Get lost.
6192355001134071 I'll be faster.
6192355001134069 The Eighth will be a hassle. But I think I'll manage, in nine days or so. Maybe faster. Who knows.
6192355000495252 
6192355000495292 ???
6192355000500230 Why are you looking for him?
6192355000500231 What's he so afraid of?
6192355000500232 So he hasn't been home for a while?
6192355000500229 My respects to you, esegher. You looking for him, too?\nHe has not come yet. Sly.
6192355000500234 Why are you so persistent?
6192355000500233 This is our third night of waiting.
6192355000500236 What has he done?
6192355000500237 为什么？
6192355000500235 Elders say he's wronged us grievously. Elders say many Khatanghe will die for his misdeeds.
6192355000500239 Come on. How did he wrong you?
6192355000500240 Olonngo? Oh, right. "A ford." Your name for the屠宰场.
6192355000500238 A bull knows when olonngo is near. He doesn't want to go in. Pushes back.
6192355000500242 父亲 was <i>so</i> right to send me away from here.
6192355000500243 Indeed. Thinking is hard.
6192355000500244 Go away. Clearly he knows you've laid your ambush here.
6192355000500241 Who knows? Who cares? Elders say, and we obey. What is there to think about? Why think without reason? Too soon to think.
6192355000500209

6192355000503651 斯塔克·鲁宾
6192355000504653 这么短时间可什么都做不了。
6192355000504654 你和...他们是一伙的？
6192355000504655 你怎么知道我的名字？
6192355000504652 布拉克，你离死亡不远了，只剩几分钟可活。我是来宣布你的死讯的。
6192355000504657 什么旅程？
6192355000504656 我无所不知。这是我倒霉工作的一部分，我是来这里安排你的旅行的。
6192355000504659 平和？没错。他们为什么想杀我？
6192355000504660 那我的命运呢？
6192355000504658 当然不是。他们只不过是平和的小镇居民。工匠，工厂工人，好儿子和父亲… 但是我不一样，我更加危险，我是死亡的面具。
6192355000504662 真的？为什么？
6192355000504661 这可不妙啊，布拉克.
6192355000504664 你想告诉我什么？
6192355000504663 我敬爱的同事会解释的。
6192355000504666 没。
6192355000504667 哈。
6192355000504668 我的心太软弱了。
6192355000504665 你头部多次受到猛击，当地人下手很重。你身上四处刀伤，其中一个非常深。失血严重，当地气候对你恢复可不怎么友善。 \n你有心脏问题吗？
6192355000504670 有什么好的建议？
6192355000504671 如果我会死，那就去死好了。。
6192355000504669 你的健康一团糟。我猜你几天没吃东西了，昨晚也没有睡觉...不是吗？这就是我所想的。你的饥饿值和疲劳值非常重要。我很想知道究竟哪样属性会率先引你走向死亡... \n所以你有什么打算？
6192355000504673 也许。
6192355000504674 我和你说完了。给我滚蛋。
6192355000504672 呵，宿命这个词很合适你，但是最好在你咬紧牙关前不要发表妄言。\n不过考虑到你的牙齿几乎被打掉，恐怕很难咬紧牙关。当你有选择的余地，宿命才会更加有趣，不是吗？ 
6192355000504676 我哪能弄倒绷带？
6192355000504677 谢谢，鸟头。但是那里的狗狗已经帮我解决了。
6192355000504675 好的建议就是：包扎你的伤口。
6192355000504679 我可以用更多的绷带，如果我知道哪里能弄到的话。
6192355000504678 什么狗狗，布拉克?你已经出现死亡幻觉了？这里可没有任何狗。
6192355000504681 我会弄清的，然后呢？
6192355000504682 谢了。如果我需要我需要了解更多关于人体解剖，我会记住这番话的。
6192355000504680 药店，布拉克! 学医六年的你现在才弄清楚？\n但是这不仅仅是伤口的问题，即使绑上绷带，你仍然需要了解你的<i>身体</i> 。它可不总是站在你这边，时刻注意它需要什么。
6192355000504684 好极了。他们为什么恨我？
6192355000504683 反正你死定了，因为整个小镇迟早会找你麻烦。但这和你刚才解决掉的三个倒霉蛋毫无关系。
6192355000504686 好，有备无患。小心驶得万年船。
6192355000504687 我才不需要。我是个医生，记得吗？ 
6192355000504685 我的同事可以更好地解释。那是他扮演的角色。我只是来告诉你身体是怎么运转的，这样你就不会在回到家之 <i>前</i> 就挂了。
6192355000504689 [a conversation worth having]
6192355000504690 [i don't have time for long talks]
6192355000504688 [a long, but useful conversation about survival in this unfriendly world]
6192355000504692 Wow, a talking bird! One more caw please.
6192355000504693 Got it. Now shoo.
6192355000504691 Wait just a second. A short warning here. You can, of course, rely on telepathy to skip a conversation. But do keep in mind that you will never be able to return to it again. Ever.
6192355000504695 All right, fine. You've got three minutes. What did you want to tell me?
6192355000504696 [and this is where this conversation ends]
6192355000504694 无需拐弯抹角。 Be my guest, cover your ears, sing la la la—it will all end soon, anyway. Even a conversation skipped will leave… crumbs of meaning in your mind.\nYou'll still be able to limp to the next plot point. But you'll reach the destination with a head just as empty as it is now.
6192355000504698 有吃的么？鸟食也成。
6192355000504699 我正打算和你同事对话，我把你俩弄混了。你们看起来挺像的。
6192355000504697 不屈不挠，嚯？好。也许这样你能活个一两天。
6192355000504701 不好说。老实说，我已经累得快死了。
6192355000504702 是的。顺着铁路去仓库也就几步路的事。
6192355000504700 食物商店里有卖。虽然以你的名声，他们不会热情迎接你。 \n但是附近有一个肉类仓库很容易破门而入，得手的罪犯往往顺着铁轨溜了。在那里，直走后右拐。觉得你可以赶得上他们吗？ 
6192355000504704 当然。
6192355000504705 事实上，我可以看地图。
6192355000504706 多谢，我已经知道了。
6192355000504703 你可以在某人的地盘睡觉...如果他们喜欢你的话。我非常怀疑附近有没有这种人，即使...人们原谅了你。\n你没有自己的房子，我估计。你知道那能找到地方住吗？
6192355000504708 容易可不是我的作风。
6192355000504709 还有什么有用的建议吗？
6192355000504707 祝你顺风，布拉克。尽管我怀疑这是否容易，无论老天帮不帮你。
6192355000504711 好吧。
6192355000504712 我已经和它说过了。你们都毫无用处。
6192355000504713 没有他的智慧我也能自己处理，我确信。
6192355000504710 小心谨慎，偷偷摸摸。现在的人们提心吊胆，二话不说就动手。不要相信任何人。和我旁边尊敬的同事说吧，他有话和你说。 
6192355000504715 毫无头绪。
6192355000504716 我不是任何人的warden，跟别提是一个让我很不爽的鸟。 
6192355000504714 欢迎回家，Warden。你离开了一阵子，你大概已经不记得蓷薾在风中刺激的气味了...知道你为什么遭受攻击吗？
6192355000504718 半个。我父亲是大草原人。
6192355000504719 这是个古老的传统。现在没人记得了。
6192355000504720  所以现在这是你的工作了？
6192355000504717 粗鲁。你认为嘲讽我很明智吗？俗话说：“做人留一线,日后好相见”。\n"Wardens," 布拉克,是你的家族在当地大草原血亲中扮演的角色。你 <i>是</i>一个大草原人，不是吗？ 
6192355000504722 父亲就是那种能记住一切的人。
6192355000504723 没错。当地人很尊重他。
6192355000504721 你父亲是的。
6192355000504725 是的。
6192355000504726 到此为止。我不会再和你讨论我的父亲了。
6192355000504727 他是我回来的原因。他写信召我回来。 说存在一个威胁。你知道有关事情吗？
6192355000504724 的确。老伊西多·布拉克一名真正医生的表率——也是一个真正的人类。虽然说也是个可悲的人。你敬仰你的父亲吗？
6192355000504729 我应该为他们感到难过吗？或许说声抱歉？
6192355000504730 这和我有什么关系？
6192355000504731 谁被杀了？
6192355000504728 整个小镇都在寻找一个凶手。昨晚，一个备受尊敬的重要人物被杀害。镇民爱他，更甚于孩子爱父亲。不要对他们太苛刻了。
6192355000504733 我知道。
6192355000504734 哦，所以我们现在是同事了？
6192355000504732 你应该这么做。你父亲会的。他是一个出色的医生，远胜我们俩。
6192355000504736 父亲和我是实践出真知，不像你。不要把我们混为一谈。
6192355000504737 不要打扰我父亲。你想要我做什么？
6192355000504735 实际上，我更像是个经理。不过我们也接触这个领域。我们和你的父亲也算做过不少生意。
6192355000504739 多少。
6192355000504740 我知道，就剩几分钟了。你同事和我说过了。
6192355000504738 无所谓了。这不重要。 时间紧迫。哦，顺便说一句，布拉克...时间很重要，用时需谨慎。要知道你剩下的不多了。
6192355000504742 所以你是调查员？
6192355000504741 你对这名受害者的了解远低于你的想象，但是比大多数人要更了解。别担心，你不久会明白的。但是就我个人而言，不能泄露这方面的信息了。这是调查员的特权。
6192355000504744 从没。
6192355000504745 你干嘛关心这么多呢，大鸟？
6192355000504746 你认识他？不想。他不喜欢把脸隐藏在面具下的人。
6192355000504743 我们不都是吗？每个人都会说谎，你只有运用大脑才能刨根问底。这是你父亲曾经说过的。我引用的是他原话，分毫不差。因为我碰巧认识他。而且今天我们更加熟悉了。你呢? 你们经常争吵吗？ 
6192355000504748 是的。
6192355000504749 我们家族都是。问这干嘛？
6192355000504750 他绝对不会遭受任何耻辱、
6192355000504747 没有什么再威胁到他了，相信我。或许耻辱能够？不过也不太可能。你是一个有责任感的人，不是吗？
6192355000505152 我打算活到八十岁，绝对不会少。我们是个长寿的家庭。
6192355000505151 好吧...其实还长一点。
6192355000505154 我身体很好。 相信 <i>我，</i>我才是这里的医生。
6192355000505155 我的确应该赶快回家。毕竟这是我重返小镇的原因。
6192355000505156 我不太喜欢你，鸟头。
6192355000505153 你还剩两周不到，布拉克。十二天左右。相信我，我是个...专科医生。所以合理利用你的时间，现在赶快回家。你还在这浪费时间干什么？你的父亲正在等你。
6192355000505158 我的脸很正常，谢谢。
6192355000505159 但我是当地人。我就是这出生的。
6192355000505157 你恰好仗着一张 <i>那样的</i>脸。既可疑又陌生，一脸凶相...
6192355000505161 [i'd like to know that]
6192355000505162 [我会自己弄清的]
6192355000505160 [a conversation about your recent past and likely future]
6192355000505164 哇哦，一只会说话的鸟！ One more caw please.
6192355000505165 Got it. Now shoo.
6192355000505163 且慢。A short warning here. You can, of course, rely on telepathy to skip a conversation. But do keep in mind that you will never be able to return to it again. Ever.
6192355000505167 好的，行。你有三分钟时间，想对我说什么？ 
6192355000505168 [and this is where this conversation ends]
6192355000505166 You don't have to mince words. Be my guest, cover your ears, sing la la la—it will all end soon, anyway. Even a conversation skipped will leave… crumbs of meaning in your mind.\nYou'll still be able to limp to the next plot point. But you'll reach the destination with a head just as empty as it is now.
6192355000504651 执行者
6192355000735952 What are you doing here?
6192355000735953 You should leave, Khatanghe. No good will come of you being here.
6192355000735954 He's not here.
6192355000735951 If you're here, then so is he. Good. I'll tell the others. There's only four of us here; we'll need to call for help.
6192355000735956 That leaves me no choice. I'll have to use lethal force.
6192355000735957 It's good to know there are only four of you. And all separated, too.
6192355000735955 You're a bad liar, Khatangher. It is unbecoming. We will not lie to you. We will call for help.
6192355000735959 I confirm nothing.
6192355000735960 He's not here. I'm looking for him, just like you.
6192355000735961 He's in the Termitary.
6192355000735958 I wait. Taste the air. We plan on leaving already. Thought we were mistaken. But he <i>is</i> here, after all. Your presence confirms it.
6192355000505551 
6192355000505629 Khatangher
6192355000505620 Perhaps I do want to protect him.
6192355000505621 Can't <i>anything</i> be done about this?
6192355000505619 Why did you come, kholboön? There's enough of us here already. We begin soon.\nOr do you want to protect your friend? He's dead already. Can't be changed.
6192355000505623 "The heart"... you choose pretty words. I know a word or two as well. Who is in charge of all this? Whom do I need to talk to for you to leave 斯塔克 alone?
6192355000505624 You pitiless beasts… At times like this, I'm ashamed to be a Khatangher myself.
6192355000505622 The heart of the Kin has made up its mind, so this is how it will be. If you kill us, others will come. If not today, tomorrow.\nYou cannot save your friend. He's ubshe. A dead man.
6192355000505626 You want me to pray that he dies on his own, sparing you the dirty work? No way in hell.
6192355000505627 I may not protect him from the whole Kin, but I can sure deal with you bunch.
6192355001413751 He must have done something... awful to anger you this much.
6192355001413752 So there's still a chance, eh? Means he's not dead yet after all.
6192355000505625 No one. There are no ones. Only the Whole. The People. The Kin. The Khatangher. It shares a heartbeat, a sense. It decides nothing. It acts.\nYour friend is a thorn in our heart. If you truly want to help him, pray to Stepmother Suok, kiss Earth. Pray for the thorn to rot on its own. Then there'll be no need to extract it.
6192355000505607 
6192355000505628 Khatangher
6192355000506852 I was about to ask the same.
6192355000506853 This place is fascinating. A sort of club.
6192355000506854 Just… collecting folklore.
6192355000506851 Cub? The heck are you doin' here?
6192355000506856 鲁宾 is in danger? What makes you think so?
6192355000506857 You're lying. That's not what you wanted to ask. I can tell.
6192355000506858 I don't know. Guess he's overworked.
6192355000506859 She's dead. Go home.
6192355000506855 You heard about 鲁宾? Know why the Kin wants him dead? He's walkin' around all downcast, doesn't sleep. Says not to ask. Says it's safer like that.\nWhat's he done, I wonder? I wanted to ask 萨巴, but maybe you know?
6192355000506861 Who told you that 鲁宾's in trouble?
6192355000506862 "Yargachin" means "butcher." Stop flaunting your ignorance.
6192355000506860 If I did lie, I wouldn't tell you the truth now anyway, would I? So back off.\nLike your people say: "Who can pierce the nature of things better than a yargachin butcher? Only a yargachin idiot."
6192355000506864 Huh… I see. Well, I'll check up on him too, then.
6192355000506865 Where? Show me.
6192355000506863 I check up on him. We're neighbors now, after all. It was me who granted him his new den.
6192355000506867 That's all right. The Warehouses aren't endless. I'll find him.
6192355000506868 All right, all right. Consider the secrecy maintained.
6192355000506866 Already told you too much. This business is between me and 鲁宾, not you. He wanted secrecy, he got it. Makin' an exception for 阿泰米? Nah.
6192355000507251 坏格里夫
6192355000507254 What's the matter?
6192355000507255 Urgent. Always is.
6192355000507253 Governor 萨普洛夫 is calling for you. It's urgent.
6192355000507257 I'll be there. Go. Warn everyone I'm coming.
6192355000507258 Found again? They've found one before. Me.
6192355001131761 Why not the 城镇大厅, though? Then again… it doesn't matter.
6192355000507256 It appears your 父亲's killer has been found. The interrogation is held at the Rod.
6192355000507252 信使
6192355000507305 Why were you taken?
6192355000507306 Talk to me. Don't hold anything back. What happened that night?
6192355000507304 I know you, yargachin. May Mother Boddho caress your step. \nYou're my salvation. You know the Lines and can tell lies from truth. Look into my eyes. I did not kill your 父亲.
6192355000507308 How so?
6192355000507309 A good reason? And yet you didn't kill my 父亲?
6192355000507307 For a good reason.
6192355000507311 Tell me.
6192355000507312 Wished none, but did some, huh?
6192355000507310 Here is how. I betrayed your 父亲. I am guilty of that. I may even be responsible for his death.\nBut it was from ignorance! Boddho is my witness—I wished him no harm!
6192355000507314 So what happened next?
6192355000507315 What makes you think going to 弗尔曼 傲云 would have been better?
6192355000507316 And what of it? You told 泰吉. So what?
6192355000507317 What does 西蒙 凯恩 have to do with this?
6192355000507313 On the eve of their deaths, your 父亲 and 西蒙 凯恩 went out into the steppe. They dug a hole. In secret.\nI witnessed this and told 泰吉, the Termitary overseer. I should have gone to 弗尔曼 傲云, of course… He was a friend to your 父亲.
6192355000507319 I would if it were necessary to cure her.
6192355000507320 What happened then?
6192355000507318 Digging a hole is… well, you understand. You wouldn't hack at your mother's breast, would you?
6192355000507322 I don't. What next?
6192355000507323 I do. Go on.
6192355000507321 They were friends. 傲云 would have gone to your 父亲 and resolved the problem face-to-face, in private, to avoid trouble. But 泰吉… he flew into a rage. Remember how he never had much love for your 父亲?
6192355000507325 And that's all? That's not a betrayal.
6192355000507326 And you never saw my 父亲 again that night?
6192355000507324 Do you know the Lines? Perhaps not, but your 父亲 did. I don't believe he meant evil, but the elders… they ran after them, into the steppe.\nThat's what I did, yargachin. You may judge me now.
6192355000507328 Well, then, there's nothing to judge here.
6192355000507329 So you blame 泰吉?
6192355000507327 No.
6192355000507331 Judge yourself. But I don't blame you.
6192355000507332 Perhaps. But I don't need a traitor. I need a murderer.
6192355000507330 It is betrayal.
6192355000507334 An uprising? 为什么？
6192355000507333 No, I don't. He returned to the Termitary immediately, and then the place was locked.  No one knows what goes on there now. There's talk of an uprising…
6192355000507337 So what's your sin?
6192355000507338 You aren't guilty of anything.
6192355000507336 I don't know.
6192355000507340 How can that be?
6192355000507339 No, I'm guilty of something else. Guilty towards 伊西多, too.
6192355000507342 I don't understand.
6192355000507343 And what does 傲云 have to do with all this?
6192355000507341 He has no part in this. He died before your 父亲. True, it was on the same night, but it happened much, much earlier.
6192355000512253 What's wrong with you?
6192355000512254 You deserve it.
6192355000512252 I'm dying.
6192355000512256 I will.
6192355000512257 I will end them. You can be sure of that.
6192355000512258 Perhaps I'll forgive them. What would you say to that?
6192355000512255 The sand plague. Keep your distance. And don't blame yourself. Just find your 父亲's real killer, and I can die peacefully.
6192355000512260 I was joking.
6192355000512261 What do you even know?
6192355000512259 You still have time left on this earth. To look your reflection in the eye each morning. How will you manage that?

6192355000735963 I can tell you what ho doesn't do: sleep. As far as I can tell.
6192355000735964 I barely know him.
6192355000735965 "False"? He was a very loyal student. Went overboard even.
6192355000735962 That 斯塔克 鲁宾, akhar, your 父亲's false student. You know him. Tell me what he does at night.
6192355000735967 Why do you care?
6192355000735968 Ask him yourself. During the day, he's in the hospital, working.
6192355000735969 Good question...
6192355000735966 Tell me, what does he do during the night? Where does he hide?
6192355000735971 Precisely. Outsiders have no obligation to honor our traditions.
6192355000735972 For what it's worth, I'm an outsider too.
6192355000735970 He has no respect for the dead. No respect for the body. He cuts bodies open without 格蕾丝. He knows not the Lines.\nHe's an outsider.
6192355000735974 Unente... don't tell me. I know.
6192355000735975 I think... Actually, disregard that. I don't think anything.
6192355000735976 I'll take care of him. He's my friend, after all. Not yours.
6192355000735973 The khatanghe are worried. Your friend is doing evil. The blame, as always, will be pinned to us. And we are dwindling by the hour as it is. Mere hundreds left now.
6192355000735978 为什么？
6192355000735979 You're right. Otherwise he might die from exhaustion.
6192355000735980 I'm curious now. What <i>does</i> he do at night...?
6192355000735977 He won't say. And we don't have time.\nHe needs to be stopped. Fast. Very fast.

6192355000514759 Where? At the Rod again?
6192355000514760 No. I have a hunch that it's just another false positive.
6192355000514758 伊西多 布拉克's murderer is caught, at last! The real one this time, it seems.
6192355000514762 It's not a good time.
6192355000514763 Really? Didn't take long.
6192355000514761 Yes. 萨普洛夫 is home today. It is said that he is desperate… His authority seems to be falling apart.

6192355000516154 Who are <i>you?</i>
6192355000516155 I'm his son.
6192355000516153 你是谁？
6192355000516157 You'll answer before the son, and the 父亲, and the holy spirit.
6192355000516158 At the Kin we say, "There's no answer more honest than silence." And silence implies assent, doesn't it?
6192355000516156 Son… I can speak to a son. I'll answer to a son.
6192355000516160 Right. Sorry, my mistake. Should I go now?
6192355000516161 There are no innocent men. The primordial sin weighs on us all.
6192355000516159 I'm innocent.
6192355000516163 The 凯恩s? What do they have to do with this?
6192355000516164 You broke into the 凯恩s' place? Great work, very crafty. Did my 父亲 go there?
6192355000516162 Give me a break.\nShrike, the militia boss, dragged me in here. He's had it out for me for the past three years.\nYes, I broke into the 凯恩s' place. So? They don't need worldly things—the heavens sustain them. Why should I be treated like a murderer?
6192355000516166 What do you mean?
6192355000516167 He knew who was going to murder him?
6192355000516165 Well, 西蒙 凯恩 was old 布拉克's pal. That night I saw them parting near the Crucible, a few minutes past midnight.\nYour 父亲 told him, "I have three hours left, and you'll probably hold out for a bit longer." He must have known what fate awaited him.
6192355000516169 So who killed them?
6192355000516168 Look, this whole mess is none of my business. But your 父亲 knew that he had three hours left to live. I ended up talking about it once when I'd had too much to drink, embellished a few things, and that's when Shrike took me in.\nBoth of them were gone on that night. Both your 父亲 and 西蒙 凯恩.
6192355000516171 I do.
6192355000516172 No, I don't.
6192355000516170 Hell if I know. But it sure wasn't me. I was just passing by and overheard them talking, right? They sounded like they'd planned it all from the start. Get it?
6192355000516174 为什么？
6192355000516173 That's what I'm talking about.
6192355000516176 Poison?
6192355000516177 How do you figure that?
6192355000516175 True, it doesn't sound like they were talking about murder. More like… both of them decided to die.\nOr maybe… I don't know, maybe there was poison in their blood and they only had a little time left to live.
6192355000516219 What's wrong with you?
6192355000516220 You deserve it.
6192355000516218 I'm dying.
6192355000516222 I will.
6192355000516223 I will end them. You can be sure of that.
6192355000516224 Perhaps I'll forgive them. What would you say to that?
6192355000516221 The sand plague. Keep your distance. And don't blame yourself. Just find your 父亲's real killer, and I can die peacefully.
6192355000516226 I was joking.
6192355000516227 What do you even know?

6192355000517754 How fares your kine, Khatangher? What did you want of me?
6192355000517799 Why'd you wait here? You could find me in the Town. I'm not hiding.
6192355000517802 "Akhar" implies we're unequal. I don't like this.
6192355000517753 Unente, akhar. Here you are. Finally.
6192355000517801 I can.
6192355000517832 I'm half and half. My roots spread on both sides.
6192355000517800 …你是谁, Kindred? Do you remember anything of us? Can you feel your roots?
6192355000517804 "Take advantage"? What are you talking about, tangher?
6192355000517811 Rule? Me? I don't deserve the honor.
6192355000517831 
6192355000517803 A terrible tragedy. Many die…\nI've seen this disease before. Your 父亲 did everything right. I'd give my honor and my life to not let it happen again. But since it already has, let us take advantage of this tragedy.\nLet us revive the Kin. You will do it, not me. And you are to rule it.
6192355000517806 If only 父亲 could hear you.
6192355000517805 Our people withered by the year, so that the Town grew. It was built on our bones.\nNow it's the other way around. The Town withers, our people endure. It's time to revive the Kin.
6192355000517808 To the Termitary? What for?
6192355000517814 Why won't <i>you</i> go, kholboön?
6192355000517817 "Kill." Easy for you to say. Do you think it's that simple?
6192355000517807 I have information about your 父亲—the how and why of his death. But that is a long conversation, and it will only happen when you act.\nGo to the Warrens. Kill the guards. Get inside.
6192355000517810 You looked for mythical bulls among the steppe. The aurochs. Is that true?
6192355000517809 Our elders are a single, many-headed beast. Its single neck is 泰吉, the overseer of the Warrens.\nTell him I've returned. Tell them not to come out. You and I will prepare everything. Let them stay inside until the disease devours the whole Town. Then let them come out.
6192355000517813 Do you know how 父亲 died?
6192355000517812 True. You don't deserve the honor, akhar. You are no one yet.\nBut you will follow in your 父亲's footsteps, then replace me. I'm already a dead man walking.
6192355000517816 Are you dying?
6192355000517818 I'm a doctor, not a murderer.
6192355000517815 I tried to get close, but they shot at me. And I can't shoot. They kill on sight. I was wounded. Anyone else would have been killed.\nBut you will find a way in. Do you have a gun?
6192355000517820 How can I help you?
6192355000517819 Death is nothing. Don't overvalue human life. People only matter as parts of an udurgh.\nA person is dissolved in "people." A person is dissolved in Earth. As a separate entity, they matter not at all, whether alive or dead.
6192355000517822 I won't kill anyone. I'm not a butcher.
6192355000517825 Don't you have anyone else to send?
6192355000517821 I was looking for ancient bulls. Odonghe said they'd heard them bellow far off.\nThey were mistaken. I walked the steppe for a long time. There are no more ancient bulls. They're extinct. The Town devoured them, as it devours us now, Khatangher.\nDon't let this loss be in vain. Go to the Warrens.
6192355000517828 Is that the price I have to pay to learn about 父亲's last days?
6192355000517833 No. I don't want to pay it.
6192355000710086 You speak of authority, but it's a yoke. It will enslave me, esegher.
6192355000517823 You are a butcher. He who knows the Lines is a butcher. He who can dissect a great bull is a butcher. He who fears not blood.\nPay your price for your 父亲's authority. It is always paid in blood.
6192355000517830 I'll come back to you with news from 泰吉.
6192355000517834 This is not my way… akhar.
6192355000517829 Yes. There is no other way.
6192355000669954 Is the path to the blood clear?
6192355000813102 Tell me what's waiting for me there.
6192355000669953 Time for you to go to Olonngo. The屠宰场.
6192355000813104 I don't care about the Kin. I just want to make a sort of medicine, Kindred. A serum, a panacea…
6192355000813105 Is this some kind of trial?
6192355000813103 Yes. That, too.
6192355000813107 An empty, ancient, mindless rite.
6192355000813113 A way to test your fate.
6192355000813114 What does it mean to <i>you?</i>
6192355000813106 What does that word mean to you?
6192355000813109 I've made up my mind already.
6192355000813117 All right. I'm going.
6192355000813108 It doesn't matter what you want. What matters is what you're made for.\nThe屠宰场 is where you'll see if this is your destiny. If you're ready for it. If you want to take care of what remains of the Kin, or not.
6192355000813111 But I don't want to go.
6192355001601454 All right. I'm ready to go.
6192355000813110 That's not enough.
6192355000813116 What deed?
6192355000813118 Do you know who killed him?
6192355000813115 There, inside, you'll understand why your 父亲 did the deed for which he was killed. I think you will.
6192355000813120 Connections between what?
6192355000813128 He must have had his reasons. He knew the Lines.
6192355000813129 I'll make new ones.
6192355000813119 He tore apart old connections.
6192355000813122 Is the屠宰场 open for me now?
6192355000813127 All right.
6192355000813121 All answers lie in Olonngo, Kindred. If you return alive but still confused, I'll try to explain it… if I'm not dead by then.
6192355000813124 Are they expecting new bulls from the steppe?
6192355000813123 The Gates of Labor, through which workers pass, are locked. So are the Gates of Sorrow, from which carcasses leave. For now. \nThe Bulljaw, through which bulls pass, is open now. It will accept you.
6192355000813126 Fine. I'll go inside.
6192355000813125 One.
6192355000813131 Fine.
6192355000813132 I'm heavy. That's not a burden I can drop.
6192355000813133 I think I'll keep my clothes, at least.
6192355000813130 My advice: Olonngo means "Ford." We come inside light and gutted.\nBetter not to take anything with you. What you cling to will fall from your hands there.\nDon't be scared of that. If you mount the Ford, they will return. And you will understand.
6192355001508892 Be kharanab—more talk of traditions! Now's not the time.
6192355001508893 All I need is the material for a cure.
6192355001508891 Be khara, you still do not understand. You need to find the blood yourself. See it with your eyes. Touch it with your hand. Taste it with your tongue.
6192355001508895 All right. I'm going.
6192355001508894 Tenegh… then what's the matter? You'll get it.
6192355001508897 …To become respected by the Kin?
6192355001508896 You need to spend time in the屠宰场, Kindred. Inside.
6192355000669956 I'm back, yes.
6192355000813134 By my eyes?
6192355000813135 What, do I look older now?
6192355001508888 How did you get here? Why are you waiting for me?
6192355000669955 You're back. I can tell you've been inside.
6192355000813137 The guts of our people.
6192355000813138 I refuse to rule the Kin. I don't want anything to do with them.
6192355000813139 I saw… strange things.
6192355000813136 What did you see there?
6192355000813141 That's not what 父亲 used to say.
6192355000814086 Who killed my 父亲, Kindred?
6192355000813140 Yes, Khatangher. We are beasts. We crave a strong hand.\nYou understand now that you must take power over them. Take an udhey and herd them like cattle.
6192355000813143 父亲 did everything right.
6192355000813144 What does that have to do with the infection? It's not like we're immortal. We'll still die like cattle—just a bit later, perhaps.
6192355000813142 Your 父亲's path brought us no happiness. They don't need to be turned into people. Animals demand a different sort of care.\nDon't you see, akhar? This cursed plague is no threat to us while we remain beasts. Mother Boddho's blessings fall on simplicity. Earth doesn't brook those who walk too straight.
6192355000813146 You're lying. 父亲 stopped it five years ago. As he would now, if he hadn't died.
6192355000813147 I don't believe you.
6192355000813148 …I knew it.
6192355000813145 Your 父亲 let the sand plague into the town. He let everything you now see around you happen—deliberately.
6192355000813150 Why would he do that?
6192355000813149 Five years ago, he failed to understand the sand pest's nature. He had no time to think. He was a man of action—just like you, akhar.\nFor years, he contemplated the outbreak. I think those thoughts drove him mad. When it returned, he opened the door. Eagerly.
6192355000814052 What else did he say?
6192355000814056 You're not simple, Kindred. You're stupid.
6192355000814051 I'm too simple to understand his complex reasons. He believed the sand pest would turn subhumans into humans. Creatures-who-have-not-lived into living creatures.\nHe said: "A town like ours must endure it to live and mature. It's called a vaccination."
6192355000814054 No. I don't believe it. You must be confused. You couldn't understand his designs.
6192355000814055 Wait… I need some time to think it all over.
6192355000814053 That you would come and finish what he started.
6192355000814088 Who, exactly?
6192355000814089 What for?
6192355000814087 One of our own.
6192355000814091 You're playing with fire, Khatangher.
6192355000814092 No one from the Kin would dare lay a hand on him.
6192355000814090 I'll tell you when I'm sure our people have a future.
6192355001508885 Be kharanab, now's not the time to rest…
6192355001508886 I'm not a bull.
6192355001508887 I still don't believe you. Be oylgono ugyb… I don't understand.
6192355001508884 You are exhausted, dүү khүbүүn. You need sleep. Dreams will help you sort your thoughts.\nAs for me, I leave for Olonngo. My place is there. So too will yours, one day.
6192355001508890 Then how…
6192355001508889 I'm not here for you.
6192355000677179 Yes.
6192355000677178 Have you been there?
6192355000677184 Death. Almost everyone is dead. 泰吉, too.
6192355000677185 There are survivors. They worship 泰吉's young daughter.
6192355000677183 What did you see?
6192355000677187 She's like… a lucky charm to them. A shield from the plague.
6192355000677186 Worship?
6192355000677189 Enough that I barely escaped.
6192355000677190 I don't know. By the screams, a hundred. Maybe two.
6192355000677188 …So there are survivors. How many?
6192355000711893 So you two have met?
6192355000711894 She didn't refuse me.
6192355001498465 I know. I want them to leave too.
6192355000711892 They need to leave that place. I've already asked the woman from the Capital to unlock the gate. She has the power now. But she refused me, and so will she refuse you.
6192355000711896 Do you?
6192355000711895 Yes. I've talked to anyone who has power.
6192355000711898 They want to see him, by the way. 奥吉姆斯基.
6192355000711901 I prefer 父亲's way, then.
6192355001498459 The 奥吉姆斯基 have no power anymore. They locked up the Termitary. The culprit will be judged.
6192355000711897 I do. My power comes from the 奥吉姆斯基, and from Earth. But those are only scraps.\nThe Kin can be ruled by either force or spirit. Your 父亲 did the latter. I do the former. 牛老大 维拉德's strength is behind me.
6192355000711900 Do you?
6192355000711899 How is that possible? You have no such power. You have no such authority!
6192355000711903 You think this will be the end of it?
6192355000711902 That's their right. If I were in 奥吉姆斯基's place, I'd come. How else will they remember who their master is?\nIf he acts as a master would, with no fear, with no doubt in his power, then they will submit to him again. As animals do.
6192355000711905 I'll remember your words, Kindred.
6192355000711906 You're smarter than people give you credit for.
6192355000711904 Who knows. Whatever happens, Master will get what he deserves. If he's strong enough, he'll restore his power. If not… well, he'll lose it forever. This is his trial. 
6192355001498461 Well… no one tore them to pieces when I was there.
6192355001498464 They deserve it.
6192355001498460 The justice of the Kin is swift and terrible.
6192355001498463 …Think I should go back? Interfere in some way?
6192355001498466 They'll just look their former owners in the eye.
6192355001498462 That's because you were there.
6192355001498468 No.
6192355001498469 I can guess…
6192355001498467 Same thing. Don't you know how the Kin does its eye-touch?
6192355001498471 That's what they said.
6192355001498472 I don't want to follow the path of strength. 父亲 didn't.
6192355001498470 You will have to prove your strength to the Kin. Prove that not only do you know the Lines, Kindred, but that you can also trace them with your knife. Prove you're a yargachin like your 父亲, too.\nThey won't listen to you until you do. And they won't accept your help. You are still no one.
6192355001498474 You're talking like a yoke's part of the body. It isn't. It can be removed.
6192355001498478 No, Khatangher, I'm not convinced. There's an untruth… a false Line, if you will.
6192355001498473 Because I was there to help him! Because the 奥吉姆斯基 forced them into submission, and I—their watchdog—sacrificed my <i>name</i> to drag them by the yoke wherever they'd be fed!\nOur people only understand strength. Strength alone! They don't think. They don't fear death. They need to be dragged from its door—by the yoke!
6192355001498477 I don't want power. 父亲 led by example. As a teacher. He never gave orders…
6192355001498476 And I agree. I'll accept authority over them if I have to.
6192355001498475 And?
6192355000754259 But did I understand what was most important?
6192355000784657 You're a coward, akhar. You didn't confess immediately.
6192355000754258 What matters is that you understood something.
6192355000814058 What else do they say?
6192355000814057 Whether you die or kill, you touch death. What matters is what you understand in that crucial moment.\nIf you understand too little, you won't survive this fleeting touch. Whether you die or kill, you still won't.\nThat's what the elders say.
6192355000814060 I don't think so.
6192355000814061 Speak.
6192355000814059 I have no attachment to this life. I wanted you to understand. If you rushed and killed me too early, you would regret it later.
6192355000814063 And settle debts.
6192355000814066 Tell me everything.
6192355000814062 That everyone should do what they must.
6192355000814085 Let it be so. Prepare to die.
6192355000814065 No. I forbid you to die. Live with what you've done. That's a punishment worse than death.
6192355000814084 Do it yourself. You have until tomorrow morning.
6192355000814083 I forgive you, 傲云. 父亲 would.
6192355000814064 I don't value my life, Kindred. I want to die. My guilt is heavy, and conscience eats me from the inside like sand pest. Mother Boddho's warm flesh will soothe me. Do what you must. Lay me down.
6192355000814068 Go on.
6192355000814067 I honored your 父亲. We weren't friends, but we had mutual respect. He understood me. Unlike others, he didn't despise me. He knew why I serve the 奥吉姆斯基.\nYour 父亲 was wise. But then he lost his mind, and invited death into the Town.
6192355000814070 为什么？
6192355000814076 And then what?
6192355000814069 He went to the steppe with 西蒙 凯恩 that night. The one who built the Town upwards. Across the river. They were friends with him.\nThey dug Earth in the steppe. One of the Khatanghe saw. I learned of that and hurried to them.
6192355000814072 Go on.
6192355000814071 I wanted to understand. Why dig, unless you have a corpse to bury?
6192355000814078 Put him out of his misery?
6192355000814077 I found him at home. I found him sick.\nHe confessed that he was sick with sand pest. That it can't be stopped, <i>shouldn't</i> be stopped. That the Town needs it.\nHe spoke like a madman. I saw then that the disease drove him mad. I put him out of his misery.
6192355000814080 父亲 could decide that for himself.
6192355000814079 The misery of both madness and sand plague.\nI wasn't in the Crude Sprawl five years ago. I only heard their screams—and my blood chilled, even though I don't frighten easy. The sand plague is torture, with no salvation.
6192355000814082 It wasn't your place, you mindless beast, to judge whether he was mad or too wise for you to understand!
6192355000814081 He spoke like a madman. He couldn't decide anything for himself.
6192355001312953 They want blood, not deeds. They always do!
6192355001498481 They made me drag out 奥吉姆斯基 for them to tear apart.
6192355001312952 What do they want from you? A deed, I know. What deed?
6192355001498480 I guess, but…
6192355001498486 As if a deed can't be bloodless.
6192355001498487 Blood isn't the only thing that binds.
6192355001498479 What can bind you to them that is stronger than blood? Such is blood's main quality: it binds. Binds people. Binds organs. Binds the world.
6192355001498483 Who cares? But the Bull Enterprise is no more.
6192355001498484 The son.
6192355001498485 The 父亲.
6192355001498482 Which one?
6192355001498489 They want me to kill those who reject communal thought.
6192355001498490 They're acting stupid. If they want to die, let them. Cutting off the nose to spite the face…
6192355001498488 What do they want from you right now? Why won't they leave that tomb?
6192355001508876 I won't kill anyone. I'm not a butcher.
6192355001498492 Easier said than done…
6192355001498491 So kill them.
6192355001498494 Yes, I'm afraid.
6192355001498495 We won't ever speak the common tongue. You only have the one word for surgeons and butchers, Khatangher! Can't you see the difference between a murder and an amputation?
6192355001498498 It's not that. I hate being forced into things. You're pushing me. And so are they. You can all go to hell.
6192355001498493 Are you afraid to taint yourself with blood? You're a yargachin! It's not your place to fear blood.
6192355001498497 I have a conscience.
6192355001498499 They're living beings, not cells in one body! Each has a soul. A face, a voice, a self. 
6192355001498496 No, I can't. You shouldn't, either.
6192355001498501 Fine. I guess you're right. "Few" is an understatement, though… I'll need a weapon.
6192355001498502 I'll find another way. I will. My knife will trace a different Line.
6192355001498503 I'll think about it.
6192355001498500 You are wrong, Kindred. You're whining like a child, wavering for no reason.\nDo what they want! They don't <i>care.</i> We, the Khatanghe, do not feel death—only life. And life means <i>unity,</i> the collective, to us. Kill the few who stand apart to spare the rest! Pay that price. And then teach the Kin your truth, and lead them wherever you please.
6192355001508878 This isn't my path.
6192355001508880 I'm a doctor, not a murderer.
6192355001508877 You are a butcher. He who knows the Lines is a butcher. He who can dissect a great bull is a butcher. He who fears not blood.\nPay the price for your 父亲's authority. It is always paid in blood.
6192355001508882 I don't <i>fear</i> blood. But I'll find a different way to unite our people.
6192355001508883 Fine. You've convinced me.
6192355001508881 Death is nothing. Don't overvalue human life. People only matter as parts of an udurgh.\nA person is dissolved in "people," a person is dissolved in Earth. As separate entities, they matter not at all, whether alive or dead.
6192355001362386 I have forgiven you. I mean it. <i>He</i> would, too.
6192355001438922 You'll carry your own hell within you. Let it gnaw on you. That's what you deserve.
6192355001438927 If you're too weak to carry your blame, kill yourself.
6192355001362385 You are cruel, Kindred. You ought to have killed me.
6192355001438924 We will not fraternize. There will be no closure.
6192355001438923 I don't.
6192355001438926 I am leaving you here, 弗尔曼 of the屠宰场.
6192355001438934 Baarhani, baarhani…
6192355001438925 Shi yuunde yereebshe? Why have you come, then? This is my place. The place where beasts come to suffer and die. The place for me. Leave me here… Kindred.
6192355001438929 Then live and endure. Perhaps something will change after years pass.
6192355001438933 You are. A coward twice over.
6192355001438928 I'm not weak.
6192355001438931 I can hardly stand looking at you, murderer of my 父亲.
6192355001438932 I've nothing more to say.
6192355001438930 You are cruel.
6192355001652960 Yes. You're alive.
6192355001652961 Everything is alive now...
6192355001652959 I am alive.
6192355001652963 Wrong. I've touched the heart of the udurgh.
6192355001652964 Say it straight: failed to find out who killed 父亲.
6192355001652965 I didn't have the time. I was trying to save the children.
6192355001652966 Their heart was too hard to reach. I got confused.
6192355001652962 You understood nothing, Kindred. You've failed to reach the Kin's heart. Failed to brave its depths, touch the shared pulse... you've abandoned your quest half-way.
6192355001652968 I never wanted to merge with the Kin.
6192355001652969 I had no time.
6192355001652967 That's not what I'm talking about. I meant the people. You've failed to blend in and merge with us.
6192355001652971 What about you?
6192355001652972 So who killed 父亲?
6192355001652973 Alongside everything else. Everything is alive now... madness.
6192355001652970 How will you live now, Kindred?
6192355001652975 See you soon... Kindred.
6192355001652976 But we only have one life.
6192355001652974 No, Kindred. Ask no questions.\nPerhaps, in another life it would all have gone differently. And we'd have a different conversation. But now... leave me.
6192355001652978 I'm leaving you here, 弗尔曼 of the屠宰场.
6192355001652979 Baarhani, baarhani…
6192355001652980 I'm not triumphant. Not at all.
6192355001652977 You are triumphant now, Kindred. Yet time will pass… and you will find yourself upturned. What was once atop the wheel, will find itself dragged down. You'll see. Tiimel dee.
6192355001414265 I know who you are. You're the 弗尔曼 of the屠宰场.
6192355001414266 I'm 伊西多 布拉克之子.
6192355001414264 The steppe is beautiful in fall… and fall is the season of truth. In fall, we keep our promises. Own our deeds… Our crimes. Cleanse our mistakes.\nA good season.
6192355001414281 I'm making a cure for the sand pest. I need blood. Unusual blood…
6192355001484054 The Lines led me…
6192355001484055 Don't call me "Kindred." I've hated it since my childhood.
6192355001414276 Wait, Kindred. Look carefully. Not at me—at Earth.\nThe Lines have brought us both to this dead place. I do not like it. So, before you ask anything, tell me: why have you come?
6192355001414327 Who did it?
6192355001414326 I know.
6192355001414329 But this blood came from beneath the ground.
6192355001484056 This is the blood of an unusual creature. Half bull, half man. Looking at you made me think of it…
6192355001490557 Why can't anyone get in?
6192355001414328 Any trickle of blood seeps from Olonngo. From the屠宰场. Always. Blood means the屠宰场.\nBut no one can get in there now.
6192355001414338 So where does it come from?
6192355001484058 Is this the udurgh's blood? What is it, anyway?
6192355001414337 Blood medicine, you say? Good.\nWell. I am the 弗尔曼 of the屠宰场. My life is blood. I've cut open more bulls than you could ever see in your life. My arms are elbow deep in blood. My legs, knee deep.
6192355001413757 I don't know. But all Kin seem to be there… locked up. Which is good—it saved their lives. Why do you ask?
6192355001413764 My 父亲 was murdered.
6192355001413765 An aurochs? But they went extinct <i>years</i> ago! Were you actually looking for one? <i>为什么？</i>
6192355001490554 The town is dying—yet the Kin live. Perhaps this means it's the Kin's time. They'll burst from the Termitary, and take what is theirs. Sabha spoke of that. 萨巴-ötün. 萨巴 Usp'tae. 艾斯佩蒂. Do you know her?
6192355001413756 I've been to the steppe. I went searching for an aurochs. What's going on in the Warrens? The Termitary, I mean.
6192355001413759 Better yet, you help me. There must be some sort of unusual blood around here…
6192355001413760 Do you know what an udurgh is?
6192355001413758 …Because you are 伊西多之子. His charge now rests on your shoulders. And you… you're still so little… Mother Boddho help us all.
6192355001413773 Tomorrow I'll <i>break?</i> Why the hell would I?
6192355001413774 I've been told you were in the Termitary.
6192355001413775 There's an outbreak in the Town. Did you not know?
6192355001490575 Where the hell have you been, 弗尔曼 of the屠宰场?
6192355001413772 I am a broken man—that's who I am. And you are not, Kindred, but tomorrow you will be, too. And then nothing will ever be fixed.
6192355001460852 So what do we do?
6192355001460855 I'd like to see it!
6192355001460856 你是谁 calling "akhar"? Mind your place, odongh!
6192355001460851 Stop being silly, akhar. Why do you ask when you cannot comprehend the answer? You know not how our world works. You cannot cut Bos Turokh open.\nThen again, it's not just you. One needs to see it with their very eyes… words fail to convey it.
6192355001490561 I need to understand what sort of blood it is. Can you tell me?
6192355001460854 Too little to cure everyone.
6192355001484061 A decent amount.
6192355001490576 So…the blood was collected here? I didn't know. Truthfully, it was my friend who made the cure… 父亲's student. 斯塔克 鲁宾.
6192355001460853 It's not that simple… I'll gather the people, open the entrance. But it takes time. We'll figure out how the blood streams from there.\nWho could have thought… the Ear bleeds. Shekhen bleeds… This is odd. Was there much blood here?
6192355001468052 …Fair enough. All that matters is figuring out where the strange blood came from.
6192355001468051 So? Does anyone now care what you love and what you hate?
6192355001484052 You're 父亲's friend. Or used to be…
6192355001484053 Did you know that 父亲's been murdered?
6192355001484051 Little 阿泰米. I remember the first time I held you in my palm… the first time I carried you on my shoulder. I taught you not to fear bulls.\nI do not know if it was any use to either of us. Perhaps it was to me. 
6192355001490556 Blood seeps from underground in this place. Do you know where it comes from?
6192355001490555 What can you know of the Lines, child?
6192355001490559 I know that "olonngo" means "ford." Enough for me.
6192355001490560 You have an odd pattern of speech… not that many steppe words. Are you humoring me? There's no need—I know our tongue. Ukherney ereed baina gүү.
6192355001490558 Because there is a plague. Because there is no one here to lead the bulls from the steppe through the Gates of Labor.\nDo not flaunt your ignorance, akhar. Incredible… 伊西多之子 is back, and knows not how the Ford works… Shudkher!
6192355001490563 You look…bad. Could you possibly be infected too?
6192355001490564 Go ahead. I'll wait.
6192355001490562 Let me think…
6192355001490574 Then let's go! You're the 弗尔曼 of the屠宰场—who's gonna stop you?
6192355001490573 This is… difficult to explain. Instead you should see. You'll need to come with me—to the屠宰场.
6192355001508863 "Take advantage"? What are you talking about, tangher?
6192355001508862 A terrible tragedy. Many dead…\nI've seen this disease before. Your 父亲 did everything right. I'd give my honor and my life not to let it happen again. But since it has already come to pass, let us take advantage of this tragedy.
6192355001508865 Be khara, what we need now is unity, not discord!
6192355001508864 Our people withered by the year, so that the Town grew. It was built on our bones.\nNow—the other way around. The Town withers, our people endure. Time to revive the Kin.
6192355001601453 Then I need to go there.
6192355001601452 Any trickle of blood seeps from Olonngo. From the屠宰场. Always. Blood means the屠宰场.
6192355001414293 Our people are doomed.
6192355001414301 I'm a doctor, not a ruler.
6192355001414302 I'd like to see Fat 维拉德's reaction to <i>that</i> idea.
6192355001414292 Wrong. You will one day accept authority over the Kin, so that they live. This is essential. Nothing is more important. It is the only way for our people to survive.
6192355001414304 Who?
6192355001414306 Obviously. It's quarantined.
6192355001414303 泰吉 knows not the Lines. He struggles to choose one way or the other. Your 父亲 had skill. He knew the Lines far better than me. And so do you. Your heart chooses right. \n泰吉 would acknowledge you, would speak to you on behalf of all Khatanghe. I would support you and explain everything to him… but they would not let me inside the Termitary.
6192355001414308 Let me see your wound. I'm 一个外科医生。
6192355001414309 What would you have me do?
6192355001414310 You haven't answered my questions.
6192355001414307 They shot me with a rifle. The bullet lodged itself beneath the ribs. Nothing I can do now… Since when do we use weapons? What madmen grabbed knives? How do they intend to live here, after that?\nI don't understand. What can I do? I can overpower six people with my hands alone. But I can't shoot.
6192355001414312 What?
6192355001414313 Say it out loud. You know the answers, but you won't tell me. Is that how it is? I don't like it.
6192355001414311 The Kin will. Your 父亲 was with them on the eve of his… death.\nDo as I ask of you.
6192355001414315 艾斯佩蒂—萨巴—she wanted the same.
6192355001414316 No. I don't want this.
6192355001413768 Overseer 泰吉… no. 塔雅—his daughter. That's who I need. That's who I'll go to the Termitary for.
6192355001414314 Try to get inside the Termitary—you'll find a way. Seek out overseer 泰吉. We need to wield power over the Kin, to find an agreement.\nSeveral thousand people are in the Termitary. 奥吉姆斯基's Town, the Town of Humans, is dead. We will enter the Warren. Then we will again emerge, and take what is ours. Do you understand?
6192355001414319 Don't try to pressure me, 弗尔曼. I don't take kindly to it.
6192355001414320 Fine. I'll go. And then you'll answer my questions.
6192355001414321 What for?
6192355001414318 伊西多 would go.
6192355001414323 I understand… Kindred. I'll find 父亲's murderer. And we'll seek vengeance together.
6192355001414324 I don't exactly like our people. But I want to understand 父亲. And finish his business.
6192355001414325 Unless you're dead by then. Since you refuse my help.
6192355001414322 If the people do not accept you, it's useless. How can you understand us? How can you learn our lifeblood? The knowledge of Earth, of the udurgh, is meaningless when you're alone. When you're confused, unable to share responsibility.\nWe are all responsible. Merge with the Kin. Merge with Earth. Then we'll speak… Kindred.
6192355001414334 …What?
6192355001414335 What did you say to me?
6192355001414336 I don't let people talk to me like that.
6192355001414333 You want to know the truth? Of your 父亲's death? His duty? His path? What it means for you… and for me?\nThen stop acting out, Kindred, and do as you must.
6192355001413770 Stop pushing me.
6192355001413771 塔雅 is there. A girl from 父亲's list. That's why I'll go.
6192355001413769 There are so few of us left, 阿泰米，伊西多之子。 Do you understand that only a few hundred people in the world know our tongue? That only a few dozen remember our stories? That less than a dozen can interpret them?
6192355001423052 Why would I look at you?
6192355001423053 Why would I listen to you?
6192355001423051 I am not human, Kindred. Look at me. I am an animal. Sometimes, too, people take me for a Worm. A halfbreed, between man and bull, they call me.
6192355001453652 What must be done?
6192355001453651 Don't, then. I'm a yargachin myself. I'll survive. Do what must be done, and do it fast.
6192355001490565 Well, I can see you're frank. Even if you are broken, you were 父亲's friend.
6192355001461722 Honestly? I don't give a damn about this outbreak. I just want to know who killed my 父亲—and get vengeance.
6192355001461723 I trust you, somehow… and I desperately need advice. 父亲 left me a debt, an obligation. A list of people in danger. There were a bunch of kids… and one "udurgh." Do you know what it means?
6192355001461724 I have to take 父亲's place. But I still don't have any idea what it means exactly. Who <i>was</i> he? Who am I to become? What does it mean for me…?
6192355001461725 Nothing. I don't belong to this town. I'd leave if I could.
6192355001461721 What do you want, Kindred? Tell me. What drives you on this Earth?
6192355001462056 萨巴 would.
6192355001462057 Why not? They clearly treat me with respect.
6192355001462058 Depends on how I ask.
6192355001462055 The Kin are a beast of one heart and many heads… and that beast does not yet acknowledge your mastery. No one would take your questions seriously yet.
6192355001484062 They're not my people.
6192355001462060 I'll talk to 泰吉, then.
6192355001462059 No. You are an outsider to them.\nMaybe 泰吉 would take you seriously… but I doubt even that. And the people… to them, you are no one, khayaala.
6192355001490567 I'm just trying to find my own path. 父亲 used to be so confident…
6192355001490568 Likewise. I'm not 父亲. I'm different. Sorry to disappoint.
6192355001490566 Be quiet. You don't know what kind of person I am.
6192355001490570 That's why I'm talking to you.
6192355001490571 I'm part of the Kin, too. Their fingernail; a fleck of their skin.
6192355001490572 How <i>does</i> one talk to the Kin? Even 父亲 couldn't.
6192355001490569 I am no one. The Kin's fingernail. A fleck of their skin. What can I do?\nYour questions, your words… must be addressed to the Kin. But one must learn to talk to them. And you don't have the skill.
6192355001490578 Armless? Wow. No one's ever called me <i>that.</i>
6192355001490579 And you call yourself 父亲's friend…
6192355001490577 Kindred. You won't understand even if I tell you. As if I spoke a foreign language.\nYou have no udhar—no warm vessel—to hold my answer. You're armless for now. I'd give you an answer, but it'd fall to the ground.
6192355001413777 Let me examine you.
6192355001413778 Do you have a home?
6192355001413776 Do not look at this wound, Kindred. Go and do the deed.
6192355001413780 Where will I find you later?
6192355001416852 Whatever you say. Your choice.
6192355001413779 Go.
6192355001416854 You know what? Go to 父亲's house. It's vacant—no one will bother you. You can rest there.
6192355001416855 All right. Stay here then.
6192355001416853 I am no human, but a bull. Olonngo is my home. So while the Ford is closed, I will remain here.
6192355001416857 Yes.
6192355001416858 父亲's house. You two were friends. He'd do that for you, too.
6192355001416856 …You're offering me your own house?
6192355001416860 Come… Kindred.
6192355001416861 Settled, then.
6192355001416859 Truly you sense the Lines, Khatangher… I suppose I should come there once again. To remember… and to endure the pain.
6192355001508871 Still—tell me. You looked for mythical bulls among the steppe. The aurochs. Is it true they're extinct?
6192355001508870 Bayarlaa, tangher.
6192355001508873 Hopefully I'll come back with good news.
6192355001508874 Be khara, you're hiding something… but I'll ask 泰吉.
6192355001508875 Shagnalda, I'm going! 泰吉's daughter 塔雅 is there. I need to see her.
6192355001508872 I was looking for <i>ancient</i> bulls. Odonghe said they'd heard them bellow far away.\nThey were mistaken. I walked the steppe a long time. There are no more ancient bulls. The Town devoured them, as it devours us, the Kin, Khatanghe. Don't let this loss be for nothing. Go to the Warrens.
6192355001440115 I have forgiven you. I mean it. <i>He</i> would, too.
6192355001440116 You'll carry your own hell within you. Let it gnaw on you. That's what you deserve.
6192355001440117 If you're too weak to carry your blame, kill yourself.
6192355001440114 You're a cruel man, Kindred. Should have killed me.
6192355001440119 We will not fraternize. There will be no closure.
6192355001440118 I don't.
6192355001440121 I'm leaving you here, 弗尔曼 of the屠宰场.
6192355001440122 Baarhani, baarhani…
6192355001440138 I'm not triumphant. Not at all.
6192355001440120 You are triumphant now, Kindred. Yet time will pass… and you will find yourself upturned. What was once atop the wheel, will find itself dragged down. You'll see. Tiimel dee.
6192355001440124 Then live and endure. Perhaps something will change after years pass.
6192355001440125 You are. A coward twice over.
6192355001440123 I'm not weak.
6192355001440127 I can hardly stand looking at you, murderer of my 父亲.
6192355001440128 I've nothing more to say.
6192355001440126 You are cruel.
6192355001440130 Not after you.
6192355001440131 This is my town, akhar. I go where I please.
6192355001440129 Shi yuunde yereebshe? Why have you come, then?
6192355001440133 No.
6192355001440137 I do.
6192355001440132 See this stone horn, Kindred? Know you what it is?
6192355001440135 Why are you telling me this?
6192355001440136 It's true.
6192355001440134 Olonngo used to be a temple. This town was but steppe roads, with steppe gates as its bridges. Olonngo used to be the bull's head. We had no word for "town," then.\nNow a town has grown on our back. Pressed Olonngo down. We used to be a head, and now we are…
6192355001651773 Yes. You're alive.
6192355001651774 So is the Town.
6192355001651772 I am alive.
6192355001651779 Wrong. I've touched the heart of the udurgh.
6192355001651776 Say it straight: failed to find out who killed 父亲.
6192355001651777 I didn't have the time. I was trying to save the children.
6192355001651778 Their heart was too hard to reach. I got confused.
6192355001651775 You understood nothing, Kindred. You've failed to reach the Kin's heart. Failed to brave its depths, touch the shared pulse... you've abandoned your quest half-way.
6192355001651781 I never wanted to merge with the Kin.
6192355001651782 I had no time.
6192355001651780 That's not what I'm talking about. I meant the people. You've failed to blend in and merge with us.
6192355001651784 What about you?
6192355001651788 So who killed 父亲?
6192355001651785 On my own.
6192355001651783 How will you live now, Kindred?
6192355001651790 I grieve for the Earth too... Kindred.
6192355001651791 But we only have one life.
6192355001651789 No, Kindred. Ask no questions.\nPerhaps in another life it would all have gone differently. And we'd have a different conversation. But now... leave me. Your town waits for you.
6192355001513552 Yes. I have done it on my own.
6192355001513553 I'm sorry I haven't reported to you. 泰吉's dead…
6192355001513554 They demanded 维拉德 奥吉姆斯基. And then I realized…
6192355001513555 I had to kill.
6192355001513551 You've done a great deed, Kindred. "Tom naymaa," the elders would have said. "A deed," I will say.\nAnd you've done it all on your own.
6192355001513557 You aren't cattle, Kindred! You're 父亲's friend. And my senior.
6192355001513558 …
6192355001513556 Silence, Kindred.\nYou've done well. It's not the herder's place to report to cattle.
6192355001513564 What about Olonngo's blood…?
6192355001513560 I just didn't have time to drop by, that's all!
6192355001513561 I'm glad you approve of my actions.
6192355001513559 I wanted 伊西多之子—little 阿泰米—to take his place among the Kin. The place of a man who decides his own path.\nYour 父亲 was always wilful. He lived in the Town. Took a non-Khatangher as a wife. Made friends with madmen from Bridge Square.\nI advised him, and I accepted the slander, so that he could be free in his decisions. Now you take his place.
6192355001513566 Fine. I'm waiting, Kindred.
6192355001513567 Thank you.
6192355001513565 There will be blood. Later.
6192355001513569 Yes. I chose the path of strength.
6192355001513570 Not sure it's worthy of respect…
6192355001513568 You chose the path of strength, Kindred. I respect that.
6192355001513572 Fine.
6192355001513573 What matters is that the people are free now.
6192355001513571 Everyone respects strength.
6192355000565851 弗尔曼 傲云
6192355001271555 弗尔曼 傲云
6192355001374466 
6192355001558052 Hey there to you too, 同行的旅人.
6192355001570451 On time?
6192355001558051 Hey there, 同行的旅人! You're right on time.
6192355001570453 What do you mean?
6192355001570454 "Sell"? As in, for money?
6192355001570452 Today is a special day. A Day Backwards. Usually, I collect dead things; today, I sell unborn ones.
6192355001570456 Huh. So what do you sell?
6192355001570457 I thought rag-and-bone people had no use for money.
6192355001570455 Today, yes.
6192355001570459 So what do you sell?
6192355001570462 …You're saying frightening things.
6192355001570458 In general, we don't. But money is about to become a dead thing, too. I'm preparing.
6192355001570461 Why the hell would I want to buy candy wrappers for money?
6192355001570463 "Unborn things," huh… So they're useless now, but that could change?
6192355001570460 I have these bits of paper, see? Candy wrappers. Absolutely useless. You can't do anything with them.\nI'm selling them for money. Today only. And they're expensive, too.
6192355001570465 So explain like a normal person!
6192355001570466 You like blind deals, don't you?
6192355001570464 That, I will not explain.\nPerhaps this is my attempt to save you, 同行的旅人, giving away diamonds for the price of sugar. Or maybe I'm trying to swindle you, as befits a merchant. Or it's all just a prank. Who knows? Not you.
6192355001570468 It whispers, "Don't waste your time on old buffoons."
6192355001570469 Doing things blindly… Yeah, that's my style.
6192355001570470 Are you suggesting we're still playing back on the train? That's an unnerving thought…
6192355001570467 The stakes are your fate, 同行的旅人. You're sewn to yours with a double seam. Meaning, you can do anything—fate won't let you go astray. Even if you don't yet understand the meaning of your actions.\nListen! What does Fate whisper? Should you take my candy wrappers?
6192355000524851 同行的旅人
6192355000717312 I recognize you… So you're a merchant?
6192355000717321 Shall we play dice?
6192355000717311 Ah, my 同行的旅人! I suspect this is not the last time we chat.
6192355000717314 So you're a rag-and-bone man?
6192355000717334 What use do you have for that junk?
6192355000717313 I… dabble in buying and selling. But I've no use for coins, though I often find I have two to rub together.\nI collect things. Things that are old, broken, discarded. Dead items. Memories, husks, and husks of memories… "traces," as I call them.
6192355000717325 You were planning to visit 父亲, too. Did you find him?
6192355000717330 What do you sell?
6192355000717324 Too late. The bones have been cast already.
6192355000717327 I hope you found him in good health.
6192355000717331 So you were luckier than I was.
6192355000717326 I did, of course. As soon as I arrived.
6192355000717329 What do you sell, 同行的旅人? Picking over the Town's bones?
6192355000717328 You kidding me? If only!
6192355000717333 Aren't you afraid of being out at night?
6192355000717340 Good luck with that…
6192355000717332 It's good work. When a rag-and-bone man does the rounds, no door stays shut… Who keeps useless junk? Everyone's happy to see me. \nEveryone trusts me. It makes for a peaceful harvest.
6192355000717336 An unpleasant occupation.
6192355000717337 All right, let's see what you barter for.
6192355000717335 I just like it when things are tidy. If I don't, people leave things behind, evidence of their passage… a mess. Won't do. Better to take those things into my bag.
6192355000717339 I have no fear. Only insomnia.
6192355000717341 Happy to make your acquaintance. You'll get a lot of… "traces" from me, I'm sure.
6192355000717338 I <i>only</i> work nights. It's a ripe time. \nDoes it frighten me? No. Nor should it frighten you. The Town changes each night, turns into a different place to explore. What was open during the day closes… and what was closed, opens.
6192355001435708 Lots of things. How's it going for you?
6192355001439380 Gee, I wonder! Look how nice and peaceful it is around!
6192355001435707 You grow gloomier each day, 同行的旅人. Did anything happen?
6192355001439352 Makes sense.
6192355001549951 Did you find a lot of items?
6192355001439351 People pass on… but things remain. Lots to do.
6192355001439385 No one ever gives anything away voluntarily, that much is true.
6192355001439354 Like life. Was that what you meant?
6192355001439353 People are different, and all hoarders, too. One needs a keen eye to tell the things they need from the things they don't. So people get attached to junk that should have been discarded in the first place.
6192355001435710 What's so curious about a common belt?
6192355001439379 A belt, huh… I used to have one like it.
6192355001435709 Ah, 同行的旅人. Look what I have here… a curious thing.
6192355001439364 Not a particular rarity.
6192355001439377 Guess the owner was starving.
6192355001439363 Made from cow leather. Rather old. Passed on for three or four generations… before it got to me. Worn down, with a notched buckle. So many additional holes made in it…
6192355001439366 We all had to bear it when we were kids.
6192355001439374 父亲 never hit me.
6192355001439365 So many children set straight with this belt. Parental authority is unbroken… They have a special way of educating kids. Cruel, but efficient, don't you think?
6192355001439376 You truly are a master of your work, rag-and-bone man.
6192355001549952 Funny… Yeah.
6192355001439375 Here, look at this crack. It wasn't his fault—it was the cat—but the parental response was to teach a lesson. He could've tricked them, sure, but the parent would have got him by the collar, anyway.\nThat face… so distant, so indignant. I love such faces. They're funny.
6192355001435712 Sure. Surprise me.
6192355001439386 No. I'm tired of riddles.
6192355001435711 Want a riddle? A local kid told me.
6192355001439358 That's too simple.
6192355001439367 Poison.
6192355001439368 A coffin.
6192355001439373 I don't know.
6192355001439357 Whenever it's used, it's for a short stay. Whoever buys it, gives it away. Whoever needs it, doesn't yet know. Faced with it, you'll never say no.
6192355001439360 You're not a coffin maker, though, even though you ride one.
6192355001439359 It's a coffin. The Army is in town, haven't you seen? So we'll now need twice as many coffins.
6192355001439362 Go ahead.
6192355001439387 One was enough.
6192355001439361 Eh… a couple of rags and boots, that's all those troops are good for. They drop like flies, with no artistry. To hell with them. Another riddle?
6192355001439370 Poison.
6192355001439371 A coffin.
6192355001439372 I give up.
6192355001439369 Maybe. Still, the answer…?
6192355001439389 Time.
6192355001439390 Opinion.
6192355001439394 Word.
6192355001439395 Right.
6192355001439396 I give up…
6192355001439388 Whoever likes it, can't take it away. Whatever you do, it's forever to stay. What is it?
6192355001439392 Really…
6192355001439393 You're right.
6192355001439391 Wrong. This one has no correct answer. Anything can be taken away.
6192355001439398 Really…
6192355001439399 What kind of a riddle doesn't have an answer?!
6192355001439397 This one has no correct answer, anyway. Anything can be taken away.
6192355001549956 A coffin, huh…
6192355001549957 Why am I not surprised…
6192355001549955 Correct. A coffin.
6192355000524852 同行的旅人
6192355000525353 Not yet.
6192355000525354 …And I doubt I ever will.
6192355000525355 Not anymore. But I used to.
6192355000525352 Ah, 布拉克… You don't have a wife yet, of course… Do you?
6192355000525357 维多利亚 奥吉姆斯卡娅 died a while ago.
6192355000525358 Surprising to find you here, 牛老大.
6192355000525356 Neither do I… Not anymore.
6192355000525360 I know you loved her. Everyone in the Town knows.
6192355000525361 I'm sorry.
6192355000525362 How did she die, 牛老大 维拉德?
6192355000525359 Yes.
6192355000525364 This is a shop, right?
6192355000525365 What did you order someone to do here?
6192355000525363 I dropped by to check… if everything's been executed exactly as I instructed. Why did I bother? Of course it was. Like anyone would dare disobey… Like anyone would…
6192355000525367 Indeed. Meat is more important.
6192355000525368 So it was your shop?
6192355000525366 They used to sell knick-knacks and mementos here, long ago. That's where I met her. She was buying a brooch… We married the same year. It was fall, too…\nI returned here much later… How long was it? Eight years… They began selling meat. My meat, of course. Brooches… Who needs brooches…
6192355000525370 Undeniably.
6192355000525371 Doesn't look like it. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.
6192355000525369 Everything is mine here.
6192355000525373 Repair it. Let them sell meat. It's profitable for everyone.
6192355000525374 Let it stay the way it is now. The music is too good.
6192355000525372 What should I do, 布拉克? Should I repair the shop? Or leave it like this? As a memento, heh heh heh…
6192355000525351 大 维拉德
6192355000531280 Did your people kill 鲁宾?
6192355000531279 You come with a heavy heart, esegher.
6192355000531283 So your people have nothing to do with it?
6192355000531284 Why did he feel so guilty?
6192355000531282 鲁宾 died of his conscience. He, too, walked around with a heavy heart. So it tore away and slipped from his chest.
6192355000531286 Are you implying he killed himself? I don't believe it. That's not the kind of man he was.
6192355000531287 Whom did he kill?
6192355000531285 He killed a man. We became the suspects. He knew, but did not come clean. Wanted to stall for time. Did his work while we were being killed for his sin.\nHis conscience finished him off. A decent enough man.
6192355000531289 What have you done to 鲁宾?
6192355000531290 I don't want to avenge anyone… We need to care for the living, first. The dead will wait.
6192355000531288 A big man. A strong man. A man who carried a whole world within him. A man who carried our town.\nWhy, do you need a name? Have you not enough worries as it is? You cannot avenge your 父亲, so you grasp at opportunities to avenge a friend, too?
6192355000531292 Touched him with your eyes, huh?
6192355000531293 Who organized this? Your elders?
6192355000531291 Our hands never touched him. But eyes can touch. So we looked at him. Made him look at us. Made his conscience eat him, from the inside.
6192355000531295 Do you know no forgiveness?
6192355000531296 I prefer manual labor.
6192355000531294 You can do that, too. Have you not tried?
6192355000531298 I have. Was 鲁宾's fate decided there?
6192355000531299 The Ear, yes. I've been there.
6192355000531297 We, Khatanghe, feel everything together. We hold no council. We give no orders.\nThe elders listen, the Kin acts. Shekhen wakes up again. Have you heard of the old village?
6192355000531301 If that was true, you'd still be walking on all fours.
6192355000531302 You're in too much of a hurry to call me that. I am not your 父亲.
6192355000531300 Everything is decided there. The soil there is thin, so one can hear everything.\nUnderstand, esegher, that only in your world do people decide who lives and who dies. Think so highly of themselves. We do not think, we listen. Everything happens on its own.
6192355000531304 I won't. I'm different.
6192355000531305 Perhaps later, when I am smarter.
6192355000531306 That place is a ruin. It offers no understanding.
6192355000531303 Consider a flock of birds. Birds give no advice, no speeches. They take wing all at once and go where they need. For they know how to listen. They know not the concept of self. They fear death not.\nYou'll become like that, too. All who come to Shekhen understand.
6192355001599580 Not you. The Kin.
6192355001599581 You're standing in 萨巴's place.
6192355001599579 Why do you ask me?
6192355000556451 Steppe Woman
6192355000545452 Then go. What's holding you here?
6192355000545455 Yeah, yeah, I got it. You're all a single organism. The girl's not leaving without you all.
6192355001486161 Who's in charge here now? Who do I talk to?
6192355000545451 Did you hear what Mother told you? Our body is whole. We won't let you break it. She won't let you break it.\nDid you understand, Khatangher? We leave only as a whole.
6192355000545462 Yeah, I know all too well what you mean by that.
6192355000545463 I'll bring you the person responsible.
6192355001484132 I won't do it.
6192355000545461 We want to look him in the eye. Touch his eyes with ours.
6192355000710105 I think you should <i>all</i> go to the old village. What's the name… Shekhen? What's holding you here?
6192355000710104 We are happy that you understand.
6192355001484106 And what do you plan to do? Kill him?
6192355001484131 Mob justice, then?
6192355001484105 We want justice. All must be fair. All must follow the Lines. He who has done this to us must come and observe the consequences of his actions.\nWe will not leave until this is done.
6192355001484108 We'll convince him. I know a magic word.
6192355001484113 He's only your master as long as you consent to be his people.
6192355001484133 Ime beshe, he has no power over you. Go. You owe him nothing.
6192355001484107 The one who oppresses us. The one who locked us in. The Master. The owner. Fat 牛老大 维拉德.
6192355001484129 So what? Are you planning to stay in this coffin out of sheer stubbornness?
6192355001484130 What if it wasn't him?
6192355001484134 You're right…
6192355001484128 He locked us in. His order destroyed our people. He turned the Warren into a coffin, an үkhedel. Tiimel daa, it is so.
6192355001486158 That's up to you. But I'm taking the girl.
6192355001489552 The doors are open. What's holding you here?
6192355001486157 No. We can't leave yet.
6192355001486177 Poorly. But the Termitary is open. You're free to go.
6192355001486178 I am 伊西多 布拉克之子. I want to find out his fate. Tell me what you know.
6192355001486173 How fares your kine, Khatangher? Did you hear what Mother told you?
6192355001489556 Yes, but who makes decisions?
6192355001489555 泰吉's daughter, Mother, is his successor. Be khara, you talked to her. Now you talk to us.
6192355001489558 I see…
6192355001489559 Huh… 父亲 did tell me that the Kin are like a pack of beasts, with a single mind and sense… but I thought he was exaggerating.
6192355001489560 Be khara, you are stubborn.
6192355001489557 The Kin. Mother is still young. She can't make decisions. \nWe sense each other's needs. When the Khatanghe are united, when all want the same, there's no need to decide. Everything is resolved on its own.
6192355001489562 The Kin want me to take 泰吉's daughter. I'll take good care of her.
6192355001489563 I hope the Kin want to leave this rotten place. I've made it possible. You're free to go.
6192355001489561 Ene shi yuun khun geeshebshe? What kind of person are you? Why would we talk to you? Why would we care what you want? We only care what the Kin want.
6192355000550210 I can see the hunger in your eyes. What else do you want from me?
6192355000550209 Be khara, neither wisdom nor strength speak through you now. We hear pity. It is an absurd feeling. Leave it to women.
6192355000550213 Neither did I. So what?
6192355000550212 And where is 傲云? He wasn't here with us when we were dying. The fire forged us anew. We are a new people now.\nHe did not burn here with us. He did not mix with our new body.
6192355000552252 How did the 奥吉姆斯基 get here?
6192355000552251 You've done well, yargachin. All Lines lead to the heart, yes? All converge in the same spot.\nThis is the spot where our fate connects to yours.
6192355000552254 Let them go in peace.
6192355000552253 You are very wise, yargachin. You chose not to interfere. Not to touch anyone. Not to spread the infection of knowledge.\nNow we have both murderers, not just one. Both came here of their own volition. Neither knew of the other's plans.\nEvil always devours itself.
6192355000552257 It is so.
6192355000552258 No.
6192355000552256 父亲 and son are of the same stock. You are one with your 父亲, aren't you? Where once he was, now you stand. \nA body is whole. A people is whole. It lives within you. You live through it. Isn't that so?
6192355000552260 …That's what you did to 鲁宾!
6192355000552261 Let him go. That's my request.
6192355000552259 What do you want of this man? He isn't innocent. His guilt will burn him from within. We will only make sure the fire doesn't fade.
6192355000552263 What do you mean?
6192355000552264 No. I don't want to lose myself.
6192355000552262 We want you to take your rightful place among our people. To rule us. We need strength. Authority. Accept it. Hold its burden. Be our 父亲, yargachin.
6192355000552267 No. This isn't my path.
6192355000552265 You'll wash your hands with blood and lose yourself slowly so that your people live. You'll eat fire to see your Khatanghe live. You'll be responsible for the blood we spill.\nYour burden. The yoke of the powerful. Do we have your word?
6192355000552275 Aren't you happy to see me?
6192355000552274 Why have you come, yargachin?
6192355000552277 Tough luck. There's no need to spill blood. Leave both 奥吉姆斯基 alone.
6192355000552278 I'll take care of them.
6192355000552276 We'd rather see 牛老大, Fat 维拉德. That's who we were expecting.
6192355000552280 How?
6192355000552279 You can't take care of anyone, not yet. You're no one. You run from fate like a hare.\nBut you can still become yourself.
6192355000753452 Power is a curse. Find someone else to rule you. Like 傲云.
6192355000753453 Fine. I will become your 父亲. I will take care of my people. I promise.
6192355000753479 You've got the wrong man. The other 奥吉姆斯基 is to blame. This man only came to protect him.
6192355000753451 You brought him. Good. Now you will become responsible for us. \nFat 维拉德 was a bad master. You'll be better. You'll care for us with your life, listen to Boddho's will, listen to Suok's chant, do what we will.
6192355000753462 I kept my word. I brought you 奥吉姆斯基. Now let the girl go.
6192355000753461 Be khara, these are the right words. You truly do know the Lines, emshen.
6192355000753464 Then go. The 奥吉姆斯基 have no power over you anymore.
6192355000753465 Why are you still here, then? I'll speak to the 审判官 on your behalf. I'll let her know you're only going to Shekhen, not further.
6192355000753463 Didn't we tell you she can't be cut away from us?\nDo you fear for her? We'll take her with us to Shekhen as soon as we can. Neither the Town nor the sand pest can touch us there.
6192355000753467 Kill? Aren't you all one body?
6192355000753468 I'm not killing anyone.
6192355000753469 I don't want to carry you. Wouldn't a good 父亲 leave it to you?
6192355001594795 I'll need a weapon.
6192355000753466 Some of us reject your authority. They hate you. They blame you, your 父亲, for everything. They'll never accept you. \nWe can't leave this place torn asunder. Kill them, so that we may be whole again.
6192355000753471 So where are the crazed ones?
6192355000753470 Do as you will. We don't care. We can't leave this place split. We can't start a new life torn apart.
6192355000753474 I see.
6192355000753475 Blackmail…
6192355000753473 We will lock ourselves in our rooms now, preparing. The disloyal ones will keep wandering about, skulking in the shadows with their plots.\nWe'll open the doors again when the schism is no more. And then we'll go to Shekhen.
6192355000753477 Lines make for a lousy weapon.
6192355000753478 Where are those apostates of yours?
6192355000753476 Numerous, they are. We have no weapons. But you know the Lines.
6192355001496552 A schism? Really?
6192355001496553 Because of <i>me?</i> How?
6192355001496554 Once again, I've barely arrived in a place before I'm considered guilty.
6192355001496551 A schism grew among us. Because of you, emshen. We can't go anywhere split.\nWe are a single body. We cannot leave a limb behind. It will not let us grow into a new life. Remember what Mother told you about fingers? 
6192355001498453 I know many Lines. A wise man follows his own—not the shortest.
6192355001498454 I'll need a weapon.
6192355001498452 Imagine an arm torn from a body. Hanging by loose skin, unattachable. One can't cut his own arm off, either. Too painful, lacking will.\nSo a yargachin is needed to cut it. It will hurt, yes. Will be terrible. But someone has to do it. You know the Lines? So trace them.
6192355000711875 I hope so. Go to Shekhen. Let twyre part before you.
6192355000711880 It was more interesting when you were different.
6192355000711874 Are we whole again? Yes, we hear it. We are whole again.
6192355000711877 Ugh… Aren't you tired of asking?
6192355000711878 I have, by killing those poor souls. You forced my hand.
6192355000711881 Care isn't about power or violence, you fools. I'll show you one day.
6192355001498504 You tell me. But I've found my own way.
6192355000711876 Did you accept your power over us? Are you our 父亲 now?
6192355001498506 Really? Well, then it really was an achievement.
6192355001498507 I'm glad you understand. Now go back to Shekhen.
6192355001498505 Be khara, that was truly a powerful deed. Medengshe, you have made some of us rethink our ideas.
6192355001500785 Now tell me: What do you know about 父亲's death?
6192355001500786 What is an udurgh, Khatangher? I want to hear an answer from everyone who knows the word.
6192355001500787 What was my 父亲's duty? Why did Earth reject him?
6192355001500784 Bayarlaa, esegher. We thank you for what you have done for our body. You are a yargachin. You are an emshen.
6192355001500789 Who does, then? Our Mother Superior? A six-year-old child?
6192355001500790 Have any of the elders survived?
6192355001500788 Boleesh, boleesh… Who do you ask? I am but the Kin's hangnail, a fleck of their skin. I don't know that.
6192355001500792 Then ask everyone you can. Gather a council in Shekhen. I'll come to you later for your answer.
6192355001500793 Fine. You'll leave this poisonous grave now, and soon. Otherwise the last person who might remember anything will die. We'll talk later.
6192355001500791 No.
6192355001490615 Were you talking?
6192355001500796 I've come for answers. Are you ready to give them?
6192355001490614 You have come. The body is whole now.
6192355001500795 The udurgh is our town—or more precisely, its unity with Earth.
6192355001500797 Udurgh are the connections between all living things, however different. From a sand pest microbe to Mother Boddho.
6192355001500798 An udurgh is a toonto nuutag. A family. "A place that conceals the umbilical cord."
6192355001500794 Why talk? You have come, so we are now whole. Among us blood, thoughts, words, all flow in our veins. No need for mouths. Listen. You know everything already.
6192355001500800 My 父亲's duty was to connect the Town again.
6192355001500801 父亲 tore apart the weak, diseased connections that caused this outbreak. But he failed to make new ones. That's why Earth refused to accept him.
6192355001500802 It doesn't matter what 父亲's duty was. What matters is that I accepted it. Succeeded him. And continued his Line.
6192355001500803 父亲's duty was to protect the small, the weak, and the doomed. The ones that make life more beautiful… and the ones that make it <i>more.</i> Now and in the future.
6192355001500799 Tiimeel daa, you're right. You are an emshen.
6192355001500805 You'd agree with anything I say!
6192355001500806 Wherever I look, everything's true… as if there were no lies in the world, eh?
6192355001500804 Tiimeel da, you're right. You are a yagarchin. We listen to your words; we nod in agreement. It's all true.
6192355001500808 You'd nod in agreement with <i>whatever</i> I told you! Like what if I told you 父亲 had been killed by a friend? Out of love, of course, and with the best of intentions. Would you nod along to this bullshit too?
6192355001500809 Hey, maybe <i>I</i> killed 父亲? That's what 鲁宾 thought at first, anyway.
6192355001500807 Bite kharaan, you have finally grasped the ultimate truth. Suok, the counterpart of our Mother Boddho, is death. And so we do not fear death.
6192355001500811 No.
6192355001500810 The causes of 布拉克-esegher's death were many.\nHe sought death and surrendered to it voluntarily. Was he the murderer? Suok touched him. Was she the murderer? You failed to reach him in time. Were you the murderer?
6192355001500813 …It was 傲云.
6192355001500812 It is so. You speak the truth. You know all the answers.\nThe body is whole… and knowledge flows through its veins. Listen to us all, including those who do not now stand here. You are part of the whole body.
6192355001500815 And you never told me!
6192355001500818 Yes. Now I know.
6192355001500819 Be kharanab… I knew this already…
6192355001500814 This is what our people said. Now you know.
6192355001500817 And he's not here, either. Cut himself off from the whole in advance…
6192355001500820 Bayarlaa, Khatanghe. I've learned all I wanted. Now it's time for me to return to the Town.
6192355001500816 Who is to tell the truth but you? Why give away a man who seeks death?\nTrace the Line, yagarchin. You are in charge of us. We cannot force your hand.
6192355001492444 How fares your kine, Khatanghe? Is everything all right?
6192355001499155 Bayarlaa… My kine fares poorly. 
6192355001492443 How fares your kine, esegher?
6192355001499154  
6192355001499159  
6192355001499160  
6192355001499153  
6192355001563801 Are there any sick among you?
6192355001563802 Wise.
6192355001563803 So you've split up? Isn't that forbidden?
6192355001563800 Bayarlaa, we're settling here. Most ventured deep into the steppe. Some fetch kindling; some draw water. They won't be back soon.
6192355001563805 She caresses our step everywhere.
6192355001563806 I am joking, yeah. Be khara, is everyone healthy here?
6192355001563804 You're joking, esegher; I can see the lines of laughter in the corners of your eyes. How have we split? We walk the same ground. No walls, no enmity between us. Mother Boddho caresses our step.
6192355001563808 Light, my ass. My head's already aching from the scent of swevery…
6192355001563809 Bayartay, Kindred. It's good to see you all safe.
6192355001563807 Everyone's healthy, esegher. The air is clean and light here.
6192355000595370 
6192355000596551 Survivor
6192355000561486 By "over", do you mean dead?
6192355000561487 Got it.
6192355000561488 Don't "dove" me. I'm a bigger creature.
6192355000561485 How many times do I have to tell you riff-raff... There's a quaranteent! So if you poke your nose in here one more time, you're over, dove. Got it?
6192355000561490 No.
6192355000561491 Brawl? I'm in. Go for it!
6192355000561489 W安娜 check?
6192355000561451 
6192355000561454 Why don't you attack me then?
6192355000561455 I was just... looking.
6192355000561453 Move along, move along... what do you want here? Having a death wish, are you? If they see you, they'll attack, no questions asked.
6192355000561457 Dew, you say? That's an early symptom of the sand pest. Dew in the chest and angels singing.
6192355000561458 Ah, so, not so sober? Got it.
6192355000561456 Me, I'm having a wonderful time here, heavenly dew dissolving in my chest. It's like I'm seeing God and his angels.
6192355000561460 Absolutely. I'm a doctor myself. But I <i>can</i> help you.
6192355000561461 Nah, just kidding.
6192355000561459 Are you for real?
6192355000561463 So you're a smart one. But the protective potion is real. I take it myself.
6192355000561464 In that case, forget it.
6192355000561462 ...Right, and I am to lead you in, secretly, and then keep mum? I've seen your kind before.\nFat 维拉德 would flay me alive for that, and 萨普洛夫 would pour salt all over me to make sure I remember my duties!
6192355000561466 Deal.
6192355000561467 Seven? Don't you know that greed is a sin?
6192355000561468 Nah, pal. Look for someone with more free time on their hands.
6192355000561465 ...Look, here's the deal. We're talking six... no, seven vials of your potion, not one. 'Cause I'm a family man. And don't even think about offering cash.
6192355000561470 Whatever.
6192355000561471 No. That would be enough talking.
6192355000561469 Eight it is then. Should we keep talking?
6192355000561473 Here you go. Just be quiet.
6192355000561474 Nah, just checking if you're still breathing, pal.
6192355000561472 Do you have it?
6192355000561452

6192355000584172 你是谁？
6192355000584182 I'm more of a home invader right this instant. A burglar, I suppose.
6192355000584171 You hear and come to us. You are, truly, a good doctor.
6192355000584174 Where's your owner?
6192355000584183 A "reflection"? Whose?
6192355000584173 A mere reflection, sir.
6192355000584176 No reason, just passing by.
6192355000584177 Honestly? To see if there's anything worth looting.
6192355000584184 Houses have souls? Huh. I didn't know that.
6192355000584175 I reflect the house. Why have you come, sir?
6192355000584179 为什么？
6192355000584189 I would, but people get in my way.
6192355000584178 Or so you think. But other forces bring you here, and not into another house.\nYou, doctor, hear the call of bodies lain with sickness, rasping breath and falt'ring heart. You came when needed. Do so more often.
6192355000584181 There's nothing I have that it could take.
6192355000584188 How about it get me something to eat, first?
6192355000584180 That is for you to figure out, 布拉克. Perhaps this place designs to share a story of toil and trouble. Perhaps it proffers gifts. Perhaps it wants to seize something from you.
6192355000584186 A town is just streets and buildings. I can tell what's alive from what isn't.
6192355000584187 So what is this house trying to tell me?
6192355000584185 The Town has need of ways to speak to those who cannot speak her language, sir.
6192355000584191 Where did the whole thing with hanging wheels everywhere start?
6192355000584192 What kind of wheels? Cart wheels?
6192355000584190 A wheelwright used to call this house his home. The only such craftsman in town. Our mills are not for making wheels; they are for breaking bulls to gristle, bone, and blood.
6192355000584194 Whatever for?
6192355000588254 Bah. Waste of good timber.
6192355000584193 Not wheels that bear a load; wheels to adorn a home. When wood was easily found, he'd make them.
6192355000584196 Are they? They make me think of… eyes.
6192355000588255 Labor, eh? Our town has its hands in the muck but its head in the sky.
6192355000584195 A wheel's a charm of labor's slow contentment; a circle, cycle, spinning sun of hope.
6192355000588253 But eternity is its own form of horror.
6192355000588264 It looks like adherents of the 凯恩s live in this house.
6192355000588252 A wheel's at rest; a line's in motion, lost. It is a frightful fancy, time's arrow; a line that cuts ever forward. Better to see the world swung around in a sling. For death cannot exist where circles turn.
6192355000588257 A dream factory? One that churns out futile fantasies of a better life?
6192355000588258 A factory for processing people into ideas?
6192355000588256 What troubles you about that, 布拉克? The filth of carving meat and tanning hides? It ties us down to Earth and lays the deep foundation 'neath a tall and shining factory…
6192355000588262 …Does all this circular logic <i>do</i> anything?
6192355000588263 \n…Why not just draw a line in the first place, then!
6192355000588261 What troubles you about <i>that,</i> 布拉克? That's how the circle turns into a line; an arrow fired into the darkened void. So wheels may warm a home more than a hearth.
6192355000588266 How long can this water supply last?
6192355000588267 I've noticed the drinking fountains in the streets. They weren't there when I left.
6192355000588265 This hollow house was home to water carters. From springs they'd bring their barrels every Thursday. Fortune, mere luck, returned them to us before the Town was struck, lock'd, quarantined.
6192355000588269 Guards will probably be posted soon.
6192355000588275 It's odd that there's been no panic about the water so far. I suppose not everyone's figured it out yet…
6192355000588268 I reckon five or maybe six more days. Depending mainly on the people's thirst. No one is there to watch the barrels.
6192355000588271 Meaning the aqueduct might fail any day?
6192355000588270 An aqueduct, left sorely incomplete by great 奥吉姆斯基 masters, works sometimes. The Gorkhon's water can't be purified.
6192355000588273 So we'll be running out of water soon.
6192355000588274 If the water runs out, we'll drink twyrine.
6192355000588272 Indeed. Our hope still rides the water carts. But quarantine has locked them in, empty.
6192355000588279 What could he want with gold?
6192355000588280 Who is this 斯塔马丁?
6192355000588276 Two families live within these walls, and both have sought 斯塔马丁's pub to pawn their last few heirlooms, sir. The man is buying gold.
6192355000588282 Why does an architect own a pub? Is he that well-off?
6192355000588281 Perhaps the man has hope to spare, and thinks this sickness comes and goes while gold remains. If not, he knows a thing or two we don't.
6192355000588284 If he's an architect, why does he own a pub?
6192355000588283 An architect; two brothers: Peter, 安德烈. One dreamed up the Polyhedron's shape; the other dreamed up a way to keep his brother safe. While Peter architects his buildings, 安德烈 architects his schemes.
6192355000588286 Twyrine isn't for everyone.
6192355000588287 A dangerous drink.
6192355000588285 A brave fellow, he makes and sells that dire faerie, twyrine. Perhaps he was the man who first distilled the drink that grips the town.
6192355000588289 What do you mean?
6192355000588290 Agreed…
6192355000588288 Peter's a great lover of twyrine, sir. Indeed, the Town itself exemplifies what twyrine does to living bodies.
6192355000588292 I've heard of that.
6192355000588293 I'd love to take a look for myself.
6192355000588291 Ingenious fancy worked its way from dream to matter. Such reality: fierce, bright, burning, unendurable light of reason. Only a child can bear it. Only children can probe the Polyhedron, see within it.
6192355000794355 Town's Reflection
6192355000795255 卡特琳娜 萨普洛娃
6192355001374240 
6192355000595353 I remember that. Everyone hated him.
6192355000595354 I believe the Kin despises him.
6192355000595352 Nine years ago my master woefully took the job of 弗尔曼 to the屠宰场. 奥吉姆斯基 sought a kinsman he could trust to force his will upon the Kin, to quell rebellion 'gainst the bitter yoke of toil.
6192355000595356 The Kin obeys neither strength nor spirit.
6192355000595357 Why would the Kin need a ruler at all? The Kin are a hive.
6192355000595355 The Kin will follow strength as rule of law.\n傲云 is not a fool; he knew enough to see: One does not rule by giving orders.\nNo man can rule the Kin. 泰吉 or 萨巴 aside, only Elder 布拉克 came close.
6192355000595359 Hell if I know.
6192355000595360 Same as everyone. Pain. Anxiety. Sorrow. Hope.
6192355000595358 The Kin can only listen, like a realm of infants. Follow no laws, but feel keenly. What do they feel, 布拉克?
6192355000595362 Does the Kin <i>need</i> the ways of the past? Isn't it better to look to the future?
6192355000595363 What is strength, Reflection?
6192355000595361 傲云 does know his place; no king of shreds and patches, but the King's silent shadow.\nHe dreams of one to take his place; a man to lead the Kin upriver, towards the long-forgotten past. But strong he is.
6192355000595365 Same fate awaits us all.
6192355000595366 Who could have thought such a hulking man worries about such issues.
6192355000595364 The Kin are slaves, gristle for the mill 奥吉姆斯基 built to drown the Town in coin.\nThis road leads to no future but our end.
6192355000595368 Your master knows the answer. Strength lies in fear.
6192355000595369 Strength is the power to say "no."
6192355000595367 Do you believe yourself strong, 布拉克? Then tell me what this strength is born from.

6192355000597154 [我现在应该拉开覆盖尸体的布。]
6192355000597155 [我已经看到了最重要的部分。不应该进一步调查，会被视为亵渎神明的。]
6192355000597153 [胸部被刺穿。巨大的伤口，不可能是一把刀。某种大型锥形物体。可能是牛角或爪。]
6192355000597157 [我应该继续检查。]
6192355000597158 [够了，这是我的父亲。]
6192355000597156 [皮肤干燥触摸，令人可疑。不同寻常的干燥程度。他没有那么老......]
6192355000597160 [三个疑点。凶器，干燥的皮肤和他手的状况。]
6192355000597161 [够了。这是一个墓园，不是太平间。更全面的检查需要尸检。但我拒绝这样做。]
6192355000597159 [他指甲缝里的泥土。不像他的作风。他始终保持双手清洁......]

6192355001374188 
6192355000611952 The Mother Superior
6192355000758252 What three things?
6192355000758253 Have you... died?
6192355000758254 I'm so sorry, kid.
6192355000758251 Are you sad that I went off to the friend of mine? Don't be! It all happened for a reason. I died so that I could tell you three things. I think you need to know them.
6192355000758256 You sound more adult.
6192355000758257 I miss you so much.
6192355000758258 Forgive me...
6192355000758255 This place is very sad, but not too scary. Lonely, though. But that's fine, I guess. I used to be sad and lonely in life too. So it's not that big a change.
6192355000758260 I'm listening.
6192355000758259 Listen to me, please. This is important. What if someone wakes you up now and we never meet again?
6192355000758262 Got it. Next one?
6192355000758261 Item one. The sand pest is closely connected to the earth. So it's actually dangerous to touch her. And if she's cured, you might actually hurt the earth.
6192355000758264 Who would do that?
6192355000758265 Was it a human?
6192355000758266 What was the reason?
6192355000758263 Item two. Everyone thinks it's a calamity, like a hurricane or an earthquake. That we're just unlucky. But it happened for a reason. The outbreak has a cause. Someone unleashed her on purpose.
6192355000758268 Of course. Go on.
6192355000758267 I don't know. She won't tell. My friend doesn't talk to me much anymore now... and doesn't know anything... I thought she would be more interesting. Will you listen to item three?
6192355000758270 Who doesn't succumb to it?
6192355000758271 What does it depend on?
6192355000758272 So it is evil after all?
6192355000758269 Item three is this. Everyone thinks she kills whoever she touches. Hah! She'd love that! But in truth, some people don't succumb to her. That makes her teeth-grindingly angry!
6192355000758274 How?
6192355000758275 Can I fix all this?
6192355000758276 Could I have saved you?
6192355000758273 I don't know... it's for you to find out.
6192355000758278 What am I supposed to do now, 穆克?
6192355000758279 I could have prevented this, couldn't I?
6192355000758277 What did you think? Of course she is.
6192355000758281 Will I dream of you again?
6192355000758280 Just... connect to people more. If you talked to me more often, I wouldn't be here. \nYour touch is different from hers. Yours are nice. You're a doctor, after all. You know how to connect what is broken.
6192355000758283 It's I who should be comforting you...
6192355000758284 Forgive me.
6192355000758285 I'll try.
6192355000758282 I don't know... Come on, turn that frown upside down! Just pay more attention to the people in your care. Especially 史迪奇. He's very devoted to you.
6192355001647065 Damn...
6192355001647066 You'll find him, kid. I swear.
6192355001647064 I don't know... Come on, turn that frown upside down! Just pay more attention to the people in your care. \nLike 史迪奇... I thought we'd meet here. Like we did at your place. But I can't find him...
6192355000627551 
6192355000636051 穆克
6192355000912952 Huh?
6192355000912951 Bountiful harvest?
6192355000912958 Do you buy twyre?
6192355000925684 Got it. You produce twyrine here, then?
6192355000912957 Oh… I thought you were an herbalist, here to sell herbs.
6192355000912960 How much do you pay?
6192355000912959 We've only got two weeks until September ends. We're now in the golden time of harvest. We need to stock up for the whole year ahead…
6192355000925688 I see.
6192355000925692 I'll keep it in mind.
6192355000925687 It's different every day. Depends on what we're currently brewing. Some herbs may cost triple sometimes.
6192355000925690 You value time, huh?
6192355000925693 Are herbs plentiful this year?
6192355000925689 We're not just interested in twyre. Ashen swish, swevery, and white whip are all, of course, more rare… So, more expensive.
6192355000925695 And just in time, too…
6192355000925696 You mean dancing?
6192355000925694 Quite. The Brides must have done a great job.
6192355000925698 Beautiful, indeed.
6192355000925699 I don't like them. They've got a creepy vibe.
6192355000925697 Sometimes, when I go out into the steppe, I see dozens of them stepping around, swaying. Beautiful…
6192355000912954 I see.
6192355000912953 Brown twyre costs three times as much today.
6192355000912962 Swish is a sinister herb. Its steppe name is Bardo Suok, "the darkness of the depths." But no matter…
6192355000925700 Be careful with it. It only takes one swish to see someone's head roll.
6192355000912961 Ashen swish is more expensive today.
6192355000925702 What do you even make from it? It's as bitter as bile.
6192355000925703 I'd give even more for it.
6192355000925701 Swevery costs more today.
6192355000925705 Do you even know where it grows?
6192355000925706 You people are odd…
6192355000925704 Today, people want white whip. We'll pay extra.
6192355000925708 Lucky me.
6192355000925709 Blood twyre produces bad twyrine. Makes a person forget themselves.
6192355000925707 Blood twyre costs three times as much today.
6192355000925711 My favorite.
6192355000925712 All right…
6192355000925710 Today, the special offer is black twyre.
6192355000634451 Barkeep
6192355000925652 What allowance?
6192355000925653 I expected more.
6192355000925651 Doctor 布拉克, right? Here's your allowance for today.
6192355000925655 What kind of deeds are we talking about here?
6192355000925656 What a great opportunity to evaluate my skills.
6192355000925657 Who exactly will be judging my results?
6192355000925654 Yesterday the rulers have established the Fund for Outbreak Control. Until the centralized workings of the Town's institutions can be restored, every acting doctor will receive a daily allowance. The size of this allowance depends on the end results of your deeds. \nToday's portion is your advance.
6192355000925659 I know.
6192355000925660 A nice touch.
6192355000925658 First off, you have to attend the hospital every day. It is housed in the building of the Theatre.
6192355000925663 So what is expected of me?
6192355000925674 Are you sure it will get arranged?
6192355000925662 I am just the 信使 here. Such are the rules the rulers have decided upon.\nThe money you receive is a budget for buying medicine and other supplies you'll need for working with the infection. This system should last us until a centralized distribution system gets arranged.
6192355000925665 Activities such as…?
6192355000925666 Mother of god… This is one of 丹考夫斯基's bright ideas, isn't it?
6192355000925664 Hospital attendance is mandatory and should be your highest priority. If you fail to complete your daily assignment, the Fund will deny you any payment for that day, including rewards for other activities.
6192355001647051 How do wrong pills help? They don't reduce infection.
6192355001647052 I see. What else is rewarded?
6192355000925667 Helping the infected in the streets. \nThe ones stumbling around are beyond salvation, but if you see someone lying on the ground and shuddering, consider giving them a pill. Even a wrong antibiotic helps somewhat.
6192355000925671 One less problem for me to worry about.
6192355000925682 All right, register man. Anything else?
6192355000925670 I have no instructions on this matter.
6192355000925673 That's nice to know. What other activities get rewarded?
6192355000925672 I wasn't present at yesterday's council. As far as I know, Doctor 丹考夫斯基 and you are subsidized from the Fund exactly the same.
6192355000925676 Got it. What's my job in all this?
6192355000925675 It's hard to say. The Town is experiencing an economic crisis. On top of the plague, the supply train is late. And we can't simply seize the items we need from shops at the moment.
6192355000925678 It couldn't be easy, could it?
6192355000925679 All right. Where do I sign?
6192355000925677 Last but not least. The heads of the families—the 凯恩s in particular—understand that the situation might require you to go beyond the norms of the law.\nBe warned, however: Your good name across town will also be taken into account when calculating your daily allowance.
6192355000925681 Good for you.
6192355000925683 That must be why you sound like a talking cash register…
6192355000925680 Take the money, it's in the cabinet. The final score is tallied at midnight, so the subsidy for yesterday will wait for you from midnight on. The Fund works round the clock, so don't be shy.
6192355001647054 Got it. What else is rewarded?
6192355001647053 They provide care and hope. It's not just the plague that's killing the Town, but the panic, too. If your pill doesn't help with the former, at least it alleviates the latter somewhat...\nAlthough correctly administered antibiotics will be rewarded more generously.
6192355001647056 I knew it! Everything has to be about him, doesn't it?
6192355001647057 Great. What about the deranged girl? Am I supposed to assist her too?
6192355001647055 Assisting 学者 丹考夫斯基, of course.
6192355001311552 阿泰米 布拉克, doctor.
6192355001311555 A surgeon from the hospital. I came to get my pay.
6192355001531851 丹尼尔 丹考夫斯基, a 学者 of Medicine.
6192355001311551 Name and occupation.
6192355001311554 You're the last people who should be managing this.
6192355001471151 What do you mean, equal? Ugh…
6192355001471152 Learned that little speech by heart, did you?
6192355001311553 Oh… a doctor.\nOn General Block's orders, the local public fund will now be managed by the military. Take your payment as usual. Equal shares for everyone.
6192355000639951 Manager

6192355000644352 Craftsman
6192355000662952 What's that supposed to mean?
6192355001382351 I know, I know… We use indulgences now. Here.
6192355001382354 I'm not the one ripping people off…
6192355000662951 Put your purse away, ripper. We don't trade for money anymore.
6192355001382361 Profiteers? Like they'll care about stamped pieces of paper.
6192355000662954 Are you kidding? Where do I get them?
6192355000662955 I have coupons. Show me the goods.
6192355000662953 Drag your ears out of your pockets, will you? Coupons! All food is only sold for coupons now. 审判官ial decree, to crucify profiteers.
6192355001385985 Been there already. I just thought maybe there were other places.
6192355000662957 I'd like to eat <i>before</i> I get the Fund reward.
6192355000662956 Go to the 城镇大厅 and ask yourself. I suppose they'll add coupons to the Fund rewards. You doctors are the upper crust now, after all!
6192355001382363 I'll be back, all right? Just need a breath of air first. The air's lovely these days.
6192355001382368 So where would I produce these? Pull them out of a hat?
6192355001382362 They'll have to give <i>some</i> degree of shit. It'll slow them down.\nWhat's there to mull over? Better to bend the neck than bruise the forehead. If you've got no coupons, don't let the door hit you.
6192355001382365 We'll see how it goes.
6192355001385997 You've all become so jumpy lately…
6192355001385998 Feels so nice to be a welcome customer. Warms my heart.
6192355001382364 Yeah, yeah. Just bring more coupons and less idle chatter.
6192355001594813 A reseller, huh…
6192355001594814 Fine, fine. Just don't bite my head off.
6192355001594812 Perhaps there is a reseller skulking in some shadows… Profiteers have no good conscience. Only, I don't want anything to do with it!
6192355000646251 
6192355000870151 Hardhead
6192355001494153 Huh? What do you mean?
6192355001495659 You still take money? That's useful. Think you'll stay in business long?
6192355001494152 Oh, I see a purse walking in? Or are you here to bust me?\nDon't you try anything funny! I'm the only one left selling food for coin now. You won't find a second merchant like me in the whole Town!
6192355001495661 You're a sly one. Show me your goods.
6192355001495662 Think we've only got a week left?
6192355001594803 Candy wrappers? Actual candy wrappers… Huh.
6192355001495660 Long enough if you turn your pockets out. It's not like the candy wrapper lady is here forever. It'll all calm down in a week, or sooner if someone puts her in a box. I'll have a whole vault of wealth by then.\nSo? What will it be? Gawking or trading?
6192355001495664 But you're still selling food, against her law? Bold. Think you'll keep this business running long?
6192355001495663 Ugh, clueless sod.\nThe big-city wench forbade coin. Now it's all about those coupons. Try to survive just eating whatever you can trade for her candy wrappers. Oh, and share it all with everyone else! A dictator, she is.

6192355001507905 Gnarl
6192355001374465 
6192355000669970 Your sisters… Do they dance with the plague?
6192355000814139 Are they immune to the plague?
6192355000669969 Why are you surprised, yargachin?
6192355000814141 Tell me.
6192355000814142 I do. I grew up here.
6192355000814140 Unente. This is so.\nDo you know why we dance barefoot?
6192355000814144 This air reeks of death.
6192355000814145 Yes, that's why they call you 草药新娘s.
6192355000814148 And your clothes split open as you dance, too. Which is why you're dressed like that.
6192355000814143 We can also open things up—but not like you, butchers. We dance with Earth. We touch her with our feet, we caress it, yargachin.\nWe pry her open. To make herbs grow. To make air heady with its odor. To have food for our cattle.
6192355000814147 You're crazy!
6192355000816151 I'm no butcher. You're no cattle.
6192355000816152 All right.
6192355000814146 We know how to open things up. Our way. You know how to open things up. Your way. Do you want to know why the sand pest passes us by? Show yourself.\nCut a living sister in such a way that she stays living. You can do it, if you know the Lines.
6192355000814150 True.
6192355000814149 If you need to pry something open, you don't need to cut it. The best tear is the one that appears on its own. This is the way of love.\nYou butchers are less gentle. You are allowed to cut with knives.
6192355000816154 Ugh. Have it your way.
6192355000816155 Wait. I need some time to collect my thoughts.
6192355000816153 Do it, yargachin. Prove that they call you emshen for a reason. Do you want to know the truth? See, she's not afraid. Why do you tremble, then?

6192355000822528 你是谁？
6192355000822527 Speak to me.
6192355000822530 What's going on here?
6192355000822529 I am a zurkhen. I am your heart, Khatangher. \nYou have connected things, so you can now hold me in your hand. Hear my voice as if I were a stranger.\nSpeak to me.
6192355000822532 …But walk on all fours instead. I see.
6192355000822533 This is a lie. Or are you saying the thousands that died in the Termitary were not of the Kin?
6192355000822531 You now see the nature of the Kin.\nLook: The sand pest shirks the quiet and the humble. The ones who do not know the thought of <i>self.</i> Who do not reach upward…
6192355000822535 It wasn't their fault.
6192355000822534 They lived in a stone sack. Torn away from Earth, stuck into a town, to work in a factory and become like people.\nWho severs themselves from people and from land, dies.
6192355000822537 By Earth's pain—do you mean the sand pest?
6192355000822536 Not about blame. Earth cares not if you have guilt.\nThe ones who keep roots underground; who walk barefoot; who sleep in Earth's hold, fear no pain. The ones who forget how badly Earth can hurt die broken by that pain.
6192355000822539 So the sand pest is only lethal to humans?
6192355000822951 An aspect of the earth… I don't believe in its personification.
6192355000822538 That which you call the sand pest is just an aspect of Earth. Her agony, her scream, her voice.\nIt's only lethal to humans, but not to those who forget the word <i>I.</i> Not to those who speak little. Those who have no need of words don't feel it at all.
6192355000822547 My people… are too frightening.
6192355000822546 What matters is <i>someone</i> still believes. Your people believed all these centuries. Else why feed her blood so many years?\nA pity she's dying. Few of your people remain. With them, their knowledge dies, too. And their silent language, that they used to convey and understand complex ideas.
6192355000822549 I'm not an animal. I'm human.
6192355000822550 I want to live.
6192355000822548 This disease threatens only those who sever themselves from Earth. Stay with us and live.\nMerge with us. Return to us. We love you. Don't split off. You hurt without us just as much as I hurt, torn out of you… Return to your body, tangher… and your body is your people.
6192355000822852 There is. The human way is to touch death. You said so yourself, heart.
6192355000822853 Stay here, with Mother Boddho, Earth, and live. Split off from her, become human, and die. A lovely choice…
6192355000822854 I can see the way. Tell me, heart, what is this pit?
6192355000822851 A human's path leads always to death. Can't you see?\nAre you even human? Why did you return here to us, then? There's no way back from here.
6192355000822856 On my own…?
6192355000822857 Like hell I will.
6192355000822858 Fine. I want to live. I'll stay.
6192355000822855 Great bulls were slaughtered here. Their blood trickled down into that pit, dissolving in Earth. Feeding her. Granting her life. Do you want to know if you're beast or human? Step into the abyss. Follow the bulls.
6192355000822954 Fine. I'll stay. I'll abandon speech.
6192355000822955 I won't be one of you. I'm human, not a bull.
6192355000822953 Be simpler. Be silent. Abandon speech. You'll feel what they want you to know without it. When you need to express yourself, you'll find a way to connect to them without words, too.\nThere will be no other people. Everything will be united in Earth.
6192355000754051 Zurkhen's Small Chamber
6192355000669997 What are you?
6192355000823382 Don't talk. I understand without words.
6192355000669996 Few words. No throat. Hard to talk.
6192355000823362 What are you made of?
6192355000823383 I'll give you a name.
6192355000823361 No name.
6192355000823364 Are you the shabnak-adyg?
6192355000823393 What do I need to learn?
6192355000823363 Of clay and bones.
6192355000823366 Speak.
6192355000823367 Did Earth herself make you?
6192355000823365 Listen to the words. Mother Boddho wants to speak to you.
6192355000823369 Then speak.
6192355000823370 You've chosen a strange place to meet.
6192355000823368 To speak. To tell you.
6192355000823372 I figured that out already.
6192355000823392 <i>Khachirkhel</i> is "strange things," right? "Impossible things"?
6192355000823371 All is connected. All is whole. Flesh and Earth are the same.\nWe are made of Earth. Earth is soaked with blood. As we feed her, we create a khachirkhel.
6192355000823385 I'll call you 阿泰米.
6192355000823386 I'll call you 伊西多.
6192355000823387 I'll call you Hюmhan. A creature made of fingernails.
6192355000823390 I'll call you Khooloy. I'll give you a throat.
6192355000823384 Name.
6192355000823389 You are a creature of clay and bones.
6192355000823391 你想要什么？
6192355000823388 Yes, yes.
6192355000823397 "The strangest thing in the world," huh… I guess it's you.
6192355000823398 Aurochs, the ancient bulls. "Buha-noyon," as they were called.
6192355000823399 草药新娘s. The ones who dance with Earth.
6192355000823400 The odonghs. Half-human, half-worm.
6192355000823401 The sand pest. I've never seen anything stranger.
6192355000823402 Earth. I have no other answer.
6192355000823396 Khamgyin khachirkhaltay zүyl yuu veh?
6192355000813054 Where did you come from?
6192355000823403 Do you want me to give you a voice?
6192355000813053 Want to ask?
6192355000823374 The Brides?
6192355000823375 The Worms? You mean the odonghs?
6192355000823373 The Brides stomped her. The 虫人kneaded her. They helped Earth.
6192355000823379 I see.
6192355000823378 They awaken Earth. Caress it with touch. Herbs sprout. We appear.
6192355000823381 Enough. I understand already.
6192355000823406 The circulation of life's juices.
6192355000823380 All loops. The circle is complete. One turns into the other. All moves.\nEarth lives and creates strange things.
6192355000823405 I name you Ushkhaan.
6192355000823404 Give me a voice.
6192355000823408 Not all of them.
6192355000823409 How did Earth make you?
6192355000823407 I name you emshen. You can do much. You know how bodies are composed.
6192355000823411 So that's why they exist…
6192355000823412 I thought people called them 虫人to humiliate them.
6192355000823410 They're 虫人in the soil. They make it softer. Kinder.
6192355000823352 So if I cure this disease… I'll hurt you?
6192355000823430 I'm sorry.
6192355000823351 It can't be cut from the Earth. Means you can't cut it from us.
6192355000823354 I don't believe it. It can't just all go away. You can't simply dissolve…
6192355000823431 I don't want you to go. You make the world a more beautiful place.
6192355000823353 You know the answer.
6192355000823356 That's fine. You're not children anymore.
6192355000823357 Suits you fine.
6192355000823355 The umbilical cord will stay. But what will flow through it?
6192355000823359 …I do. You are unique.
6192355000823360 Some come, others go. Life doesn't stop just because one piece ceased to exist.
6192355000823358 Don't you care for this loss? We are the last of our kind.
6192355000823414 "Medrel." You mean the nerves?
6192355000823419 I'm a doctor. It's my job to destroy it. For the people.
6192355000823413 It's not a disease. It's pain. Earth's anguish.\nWhat you call the sand plague is an aspect of Earth. An agony. A scream. Its voice. Its <i>medrel.</i>
6192355000823416 You don't need to croak. I'll give you a throat. I name you Amahn.
6192355000823422 I want to wake up.
6192355000823415 Emshen.
6192355000823418 You're not sick.
6192355000823427 What's wrong with you?
6192355000823417 You are a wise doctor, maes zaslыm emch. Will you care for me?
6192355000823421 So how do I handle the disease? If you're all one and the same…
6192355000823420 People have destroyed everything that makes Earth alive. They turned Olonngo into an屠宰场. They added a Termitary. They herded the people inside, robbed them of life.\nThey killed our last great bull.
6192355000823424 I am a doctor. The only thing I fight is the disease. The sand plague.
6192355000823425 I couldn't hurt you even if I wanted to.
6192355000823426 Yes. I promise.
6192355000823423 Mother Boddho speaks through me.\nListen, for she asks: Will you spare me? Will you let me live?
6192355000823429 My job is to cure the sand pest.
6192355000823428 If you do your job, I will die.

6192355000677152 You tricked me.
6192355000677163 What is important, then?
6192355000677151 He'll come forward on his own, soon.\nBut that's not important! Forget about revenge. I don't need it.
6192355000828351 你好，父亲.
6192355000829951 所以你还活着...?
6192355000677162 谁杀害了您，父亲?
6192355000677161 你好，我的儿子。
6192355000829953 I'm not.
6192355000829960 I am.
6192355000829961 <i>You</i> seem angry with me.
6192355000829952 You seem angry with me.
6192355000829955 You've done what?
6192355000829954 Yes. See, I've done it. I'm just as surprised as you are.
6192355000829957 How?
6192355000829956 I transcended death.
6192355000829959 …What do I do now?
6192355000829964 How?
6192355000829958 I don't know.\nDeath is a mire, engulfing those who cross. But some escape.
6192355000829963 Is it true that you were the one who unleashed the plague?
6192355000829965 I've been told you're the reason for this outbreak.
6192355000829962 All I ever wanted was for you to understand what happened here. How it all went. Why it was needed.
6192355000829967 You didn't stop it. You could have, like the first. But you didn't.
6192355000829970 You let this plague happen.
6192355000829971 You were patient zero. You brought the plague to this town.
6192355000829966 Too strong a word.
6192355000829969 This is cruel.
6192355000829978 Why did you summon me?
6192355000829968 Five years ago, I made a mistake. We never should have tried to hide from this disease. The Town needed to survive it. Or not.
6192355000829973 But 为什么？
6192355000829972 Yes.
6192355000829975 I don't understand.
6192355000829974 If you survive a disease, you develop immunity.\nOur town was grown in a greenhouse. It is a homunculus. Not particularly well adjusted to live on its own.\nWe couldn't support it forever. 西蒙 and I were growing old. The Mistresses died. How would it fare without us?
6192355000829977 You think my line of fate is more precise than yours?
6192355000829976 This town was… connected <i>wrong.</i> Its parts were tied with artificial seams—so different, so awkward. One could say that 西蒙, the Mistresses, and I held it all together by force.\nSo I tore it apart, so you can sew it all back, better than before. Because you're better, and smarter, than I am.
6192355000829980 So you did it for me…?
6192355000829979 All I wanted was for you to understand, not follow any particular fate.
6192355000829982 What are you trying to say?
6192355000829981 Of course not. I did it for the Town. It needed a vaccination. Besides, it wasn't up to me.
6192355000829984 You're saying horrible things. For the Town, huh? What about all the victims? Were they not part of the Town?
6192355000829983 I stopped trying to ladle out the sea and walked straight into it. I made everyone walk with me, too. Teaching them to swim, so they'll no longer hide behind sand castle walls.
6192355000829986 I choose the past, even with the plague and sand castles. I can't bear to lose all its uniqueness.
6192355000829987 You're right. The future is better than the past. Tell me more about it.
6192355000829985 The Town needs to move forward, but it doesn't insist. Facing the future is the way of love. Facing the past is the way of love.\nBut the two are incompatible, and it broke my heart.
6192355000829989 What should I do now, 父亲?
6192355000829988 You need not choose. Not yet.\nMoreover, you've already made your choice. Your actions did. For they were driven by love, whether you wanted that or not.\nLove came from understanding. Understanding creates connections. Connections are the Lines. The Lines are love.
6192355000829991 What should I do now, 父亲?
6192355000829990 My list… Those children will build the new Town. A better one.\nJust like the three families and their Mistresses built it before. Just like 西蒙 and I built it, reaching to the stars.\nWe started it too quickly. We paid for our hastiness.
6192355000829993 I hope so.
6192355000829994 You'd do it better.
6192355000829992 Do what you must. Do what you think is right. If you still have time, try to understand the world as best you can.\nYou won't make a mistake. I respect your choice—any choice. Like I said, you're better than me. You will connect us all into a new whole.
6192355000753566 伊西多·布拉克
6192355000679754 Because of you, the Town floods with infected corpses.
6192355000679755 So the 凯恩s ordered for corpses to be embalmed?
6192355000679756 I'm my own man.
6192355000679753 I'm not sharing my formula, if that's what you're after. I don't need competition, thank you very much. Or are you here to put a stop to my little enterprise? Like hell you will! I am the 凯恩s' man. You belong to 奥吉姆斯基.
6192355000679758 You're a criminal.
6192355000679759 Those are not my furnaces. Those are the furnaces of fate.
6192355000679757 People want to protect their loved ones from the flames. Rightfully so. I'm helping them preserve those bodies, as is my duty. Do you think they'd throw the dead into your furnaces if I'm not there? Think again, steppe man.
6192355000679761 What border?
6192355000679762 So Victor doesn't actually know about this, does he?
6192355000679760 The 凯恩s don't need order. They inspire.\nBy their teachings, crossing the great border requires strange but simple steps. They despise death and refuse to play by its rules.\nWho knows? Perhaps preserving the bodies of the dead is the first step toward victory over death. Victor would approve of my work.
6192355000679764 Are you sure the dead would want to be resurrected?
6192355000679765 You've lost it.
6192355000679763 Death is that border, the limit of our existence. Decay limits our capacity to survive as material creatures. Who knows what it takes to defeat death? Ancients believed that the dead might rise as living bodies.
6192355000679767 We'll see about that, 凯恩 servant.
6192355000679768 I'll pay him a visit and ask in person.
6192355000679769 Tell your people to stay out of my way, or they'll regret it.
6192355000679766 维克多凯恩 is shouldering the burden of fighting the epidemic. I'm sure he's well aware of what I'm doing here. The 凯恩s haven't stopped me—meaning they approve. This is the 凯恩 way. To cattle, the greatest achievements seem like transgressions.
6192355000995082 你看起来一点不友善，现在打烊是不是太早了？ 
6192355000995083 老瓦在哪?
6192355000995081 我们要打烊了。
6192355000995085 他会的，我是伊西多·布拉克之子.
6192355000995089 但是我认识他，我也知道他卖什么。而且我带了他想要的东西。而且这种货物可放不了太久。所以？ 
6192355000995084 我不知道你在说什么？
6192355000995087 我想见老瓦.
6192355000995088 我带了肉来。
6192355000995086 这是我的店。我想打烊就打烊。你想要什么？
6192355000995091 那取决于我，老兄。
6192355000995092 明白了。你，继续打烊吧。你是想打烊对吧？ 
6192355000995090 你右手边的门。然后左转，直走。搞快点。

6192355000694154 房屋检查，让我进去。 
6192355000694152 有什么需要帮忙的吗？医生？
6192355000694156 让我进去。
6192355000694157 噪声是怎么回事？
6192355000694155 这里一切正常，老天保佑。 
6192355000694159 楼上，二楼。
6192355000694160 你耳朵有问题吗？
6192355000694158 什么声音？
6192355000694162 Do I need to kick you?
6192355000694163 I heard odd sounds.
6192355000694161 What for?
6192355000694165 I love cats. Can I come up and pet it?
6192355000694166 Step aside. Now!
6192355000694164 是猫。
6192355000694168 Fine. I'll send orderlies here, then. Would you rather deal with them?
6192355000694169 我说，闪一边去！否则！
6192355000694170 Whatever.
6192355000694167 This is neighborly business, doctor. We don't need you here. Get the hint already.
6192355000694151 
6192355000695551 Concerned One
6192355000697611 This place is dangerous.
6192355000697614 My kids are up ahead. Let me through.
6192355000697609 No grown-ups allowed up there.
6192355001514085 How are you special?
6192355001514096 You're not afraid of anything, are you, creepy kids?
6192355000697612 It's dangerous for you. But not for us.
6192355000697616 If you keep arguing with me, I'll fall down myself. From the disease. Is that what you want?
6192355001514084 This place is dangerous.
6192355000697615 Thousands of parents have asked that, standing right where you're at.\nThe answer is no. No grown-ups allowed. Or it will all fall down.
6192355000697618 Why are you all here?
6192355000697617 What do you mean? Inside? You wouldn't understand. And honestly, neither do we.
6192355000697620 It it falls, it won't be because of me. Let me through!
6192355001514097 Fine. To hell with you.
6192355000697619 We're scared of the cannon. And we're afraid for the Tower.\nIf they start firing, it could collapse, you know. Or fall. Or rip apart. Basically, it can die.
6192355001514083 I've forgotten that children are cruel and fearless.
6192355001514090 If you don't care about me, think about yourselves, at least! This area is infected! Shoo!
6192355001514082 Why do you think we care what happens you?
6192355001514087 From the inside? Why did you come out, then?
6192355001514086 We're from the inside. You won't understand. We can barely wrap our heads around it ourselves.
6192355001514095 I'm not <i>that</i> big.
6192355001514101 Sounds ominous…
6192355001514094 If it falls, it <i>will</i> be because of you.
6192355001514100 As opposed to…?
6192355001514099 Thanks, I guess.
6192355001514098 …Well, all right, go. You'll only see stairs and catwalks anyway.
6192355000703651 
6192355000705751  
6192355000698353 ...立即去见她。不准耽搁。真令人惊讶。
6192355000698354 现在不是时候。我有病人要照看！我...我的孩子。
6192355000698360 I'm on my way there anyway. My… wards are there. If they've really spent the night on that staircase.
6192355000698352 是审判官的命令。
6192355000698356 …
6192355000698359 真是个迷人的女人。知道如何赢得人们的心。
6192355000698355 我不是在和你讨论，布拉克。如果需要的话我们会强制把你带过去。
6192355000698358 我马上就走，自己走。
6192355000698357 我们走吧。

6192355000771954 Not a poem, I hope?
6192355001427294 If anyone is to write about me, I'd like it to be you, Yulia. At least nothing will be overdramatized.
6192355001439824 I'd rather you calculated me. You're good at… calculations.
6192355000771953 I suspect I'm the only person here who has figured out that you were the one who did it. A simple calculation, 布拉克. Numbers never lie. And you know what? I can get behind what you've done. It was a fifty-fifty chance.\nTruthfully? I find it oddly inspiring. I'm no writer, but I'll write about you.
6192355001427296 Well… You're the author. I guess it sounds nice.
6192355001428651 Just keep in mind that not everything is connected. The pattern is more complicated. I'm saying this as a haruspex.
6192355001427295 The work will be, of course, scientific. But the title…\nI'm thinking about throwing the scientific language out the window and giving it an old-fashioned name: <i>On the Connection of Everything.</i> What do you say?
6192355001427298 Like a rat? I'll pass, thanks.
6192355001428752 I'm flattered. But I'd rather stay here… This place needs a vet.
6192355001439825 An ass-what? You know me, Yulia. 阿泰米 no like big words.
6192355001439826 I'll think about it. Perhaps I'll go.
6192355001427297 Thank you.\nI think the academic world in the Capital may have a couple questions regarding the subject of my research. Perhaps you'd like to come with me? As an assistant and… well, the subject.
6192355000844826 阿泰米·布拉克。医生。
6192355000844827 Just a local ripper.
6192355000844825 Yulia. Yulia Lyuricheva. And you are…?
6192355000844833 What can you do?
6192355001401481 You have incredible eyes... 你是谁？
6192355000844832 How can I help you?
6192355000844835 Oh, but I am.
6192355000844836 You're not a local, right?
6192355000844834 Little in the way of medicine. I'm a mathematician specializing in spatial calculations. The finite-element method… I doubt you'd be interested.
6192355000844838 Huh… Our town doesn't look like it was planned by a mathematician.
6192355000844837 Of course. I arrived at 西蒙·凯恩's request to lay out the roads and plan the Town's development.
6192355000844840 "A bit"? The 凯恩s are completely off their rocker.
6192355000844843 So the Town's streets are your doing?
6192355000844839 The 凯恩s had a rather unusual notion of how they wanted the Town's routes planned. They believed the routes of choice influence people's mood. Their soulstate.\nI found the challenge intriguing, if a bit insane.
6192355000844842 What idea?
6192355001011855 I'm sorry for saying this, but it's ridiculous.
6192355000844841 Well, they have built the Polyhedron, haven't they? There it is. I was even allowed to ascend it. Though I wasn't allowed inside…\nThe Cathedral, the Crucible, the Stillwater; all those buildings are machines that work with the same idea.
6192355000844845 Why the hell did you make the Town so awkward to navigate, then?
6192355000844844 Not all of them, but yes, to some extent.
6192355000844847 Do you take the 凯恩s' ideas seriously?
6192355000844846 The 凯恩s implied that the Town already has something akin to a nervous system. They suggested I view it as a huge, living creature. So my job was… acupunctural.
6192355001011852 …As in?
6192355001011856 Nah, they've just let their wealth go to their heads. Huge fortunes, weird fantasies, and unrestricted power will do that to people.
6192355001011851 When a person finds themselves in a relatively enclosed space, it influences their inner state in a certain way. It's no secret.\nThe 凯恩s are trying to create buildings that enhance spiritual growth.
6192355001011854 Why stretch it?
6192355001011853 Well, we're moving to the field of philosophy now… Not my area of expertise.\nBut as far as I can tell, in their eyes, humans aren't paragon of animals, but rather larvae. They believe the human spirit is a spring to be stretched. Their favorite image.
6192355001011860 Such attempts do not bode well.
6192355001011861 People do that their whole lives anyway.
6192355001011862 …Does that <i>really</i> demand making roads so confusing?
6192355001011859 To make people desire new things. Weird things. Things beyond their limits.
6192355000844829 Why did you come?
6192355000844849 No.
6192355000844828 Can I do anything?
6192355000844831 You're a scientist. There's no work for you here.
6192355001241478 Like counting corpses? Fine work for a mathematician, in times like these.
6192355000844830 I just want to be of help.
6192355001241477 You are a brave woman. But looking after these patients… is pointless. They're all doomed.
6192355001241485 Such as?
6192355001241476 I could look after the sick. I'm not afraid of dirty work. But, actually, I have quite a few skills aside from mathematics.
6192355001241480 True…
6192355001241481 But that would be a waste. A pointless sacrifice on your part. Suicide!
6192355001241479 That doesn't mean they don't deserve care.
6192355001241483 An impressive list.
6192355001241484 Still, you should go home now. There's nothing for you to do here.
6192355001241482 I can sew, tie knots, tell stories, do card tricks, play cello, and repair equipment. Although, I doubt any of that would be useful here.\nUnfortunately, I can't walk around too much, on account of my leg.
6192355001241487 Is that not enough for you?
6192355001241488 Sisyphean toil…
6192355001241486 If that's irony I hear, It's misplaced. This is precisely the work I was tasked with at the 城镇大厅: statistics. Orderlies do the rounds and count the sick and dead, then I work with the data.
6192355001253556 Is that the probability of execution, or salvation?
6192355001418272 Do you know her?
6192355001563831 What bird story?
6192355001253555 …Eighty percent or so. Eighty-five if she's been to the Capital in May. Could have been even higher, but that bird story…
6192355001253558 Do you know her?
6192355001418276 Can't argue with that.
6192355001253557 They're often indistinguishable from one another.
6192355001418275 You don't know if you know her or not? What do you mean?
6192355001418277 You mentioned working for the inquisition.
6192355001418274 阿格莱雅·莉莉奇? As an 审判官, you mean? I don't know.
6192355001418279 Intriguing.
6192355001418280 Hands, not heart. But I'm flattered anyway.
6192355001418278 I did indeed perform certain services… errands, really. But that doesn't mean I understood them. Doesn't mean the opposite, either.\nYou'll see for yourself soon… and if you don't, you'll sense it. You're the kind to think with your heart.
6192355001563833 So you know her?
6192355001563834 Wow…
6192355001563832 That's what they used to call these… special people. They had a particular way of spreading false information through a kind of… reflection. She invented the process, 阿格莱雅 莉莉奇.\nNo matter. But just that after that, she was blacklisted by the Powers That Be. Several people got purged from the government, too.
6192355001400644 From time to time.
6192355001400645 No.
6192355001400646 I do now… Hand it over.
6192355001400643 Even if evacuation were an option, I wouldn't recommend it. You wouldn't leave, anyway.\nDo you smoke, 布拉克?
6192355001400648 What pawns? Why the 审判官s? I have work to do!
6192355001400649 How do you know?
6192355001400647 The inquisition will target the doctors for certain. I know their methods.\nI mean… sure, they always improvise. Can't be predicted, really. But common sense suggests that you, the medics, will become their pawns.
6192355001401451 Right… Everyone works for the government. Always. Except for 父亲 and I.
6192355001401456 I thought they did their own calculations. Was I mistaken?
6192355001400650 I worked for the inquisition a bit, right before I came here. Calculated certain… predictive models. The details are of no importance.
6192355001401453 Not really. Tell me.
6192355001401454 I know the rumors. They're arbiters, annihilators, geniuses, and so on…
6192355001401455 I've heard of them.
6192355001401452 布拉克, this is serious. Do you even understand what kind of institution the inquisition is?
6192355001401458 Every child knows that.
6192355001401459 …Like this outbreak of ours. I get it.
6192355001401457 An organization of geniuses. I believe the 审判官ial Corps is nineteen strong. Or was it eighteen…? No, nineteen, unless Orff resigned.\nThey're tasked with solving the unsolvable.
6192355001401461 What does this mean for me?
6192355001401468 I don't give a shit. Let any government scum come. I have work to do.
6192355001401460 No laws, no ethics bind the 审判官s. They are human missiles, caring only of the mission—nothing stands between them and the mission.
6192355001401463 So why did you call for me?
6192355001551656 You didn't mention 鲁宾. 为什么？ He's a doctor, too. More than 克拉拉…
6192355001401469 Let them. I'd like to see them try.
6192355001401462 They'll take you, 丹尼尔, and 克拉拉, and they'll trade you, turn you into tokens. I'm not sure you can really avoid it.\nUnless you flee? But there's no way out. I suppose you're doomed…
6192355001401467 I see.
6192355001401470 You're an intelligent woman, Yulia. I'd love to learn from you.
6192355001401471 I don't care. Let's not waste any more time on this, all right?
6192355001401466 I just… I think you should know.\nI'm a logistics expert and a prognostician… and I can tell you some things do depend on your actions. Even if it seems like you're doomed and nothing can be changed, it's not true. A warning can—and will—change your course of action, as well as the outcome.
6192355001401474 
6192355001401473 
6192355001401476 什么？审判团？搞得好像我们这里还不够乱...
6192355001507915 她怎么知道的？
6192355001401475 看到这个女孩了吗，布拉克? 她说审判团明天将会抵达。
6192355001401479 And she came <i>to you</i> because every road in the Town leads to your doorstep. That's how you designed them. Do I have that right?
6192355001401480 Curious…
6192355001401478 She's not a local. Funny… I didn't even think how she got here. It's not like she has wings!\nThen again, not every road in the world is straightforward and linear. Let us spare the girl torturous questions, she's confused enough as it is.
6192355001507917 An 审判官's daughter lives in our town?
6192355001507916 She's an 审判官's daughter.
6192355001551655 The truth being…?
6192355001551654 Flattering. But I'm afraid the truth is much less fascinating.
6192355001551658 You're wrong. I'm not special.
6192355001551659 You flatter me.
6192355001551657 They will, of course, summon 鲁宾, and me, and the ruling houses. But <i>you</i> will be their pawn. The 审判官s can identify extraordinary people from miles away, like bloodhounds.\nIt wouldn't be wrong to say that I'm no less intelligent than 丹尼尔. And Stanislav is as good a surgeon as you. Still, we'll remain in the background. You will become the pawn.\nTrust me. I've seen them work.
6192355000794359 Yulia Lyuricheva
6192355001258456 Yulia Lyuricheva
6192355000717299 That's impossible. Stabbings don't happen here.
6192355000717300 Yeah… At first I didn't believe my own eyes.
6192355000717298 The rabble is out of control! At least they <i>looked</i> human before. Did you hear about the stabbings? There's people with knives out in the streets now, brother!
6192355000717302 我是外科医生，这是我工作的一部分。
6192355000717303 It's a family thing.
6192355000717304 I'm no rogue.
6192355000717301 I mean, I'm quite an artist with the knife, myself… but that's different! Everyone knows I obey no law. \nThese people, there's no wholesome fear left in them. Kniving is taboo around here! That's why I loved this town. But you know the tricks of the trade, don't you? I can tell by your hands.
6192355000717306 Those people with knives… Are they still trying to avenge 布拉克?
6192355000717307 Do they think night conceals everything?
6192355000717305 You're a dangerous man. I'm a dangerous man, too. We can reach an understanding if you behave yourself in my establishment.
6192355000717309 That's fair. Only a butcher has the right to cut flesh.
6192355000717310 Judge 凯恩… Do you mean old Georgiy? That means it's serious.
6192355000717308 I don't even care. If they come here, they'll regret it. He who lives by the knife, dies by the knife! Such people are outlaws. Killing them incurs no punishment, only gratitude. Judge 凯恩 said so.
6192355000965852 Appearance isn't everything.
6192355000965853 Look who's talking.
6192355000965851 Hah, what a face! A loser's face.
6192355000739552 So, I hear you're an architect?
6192355000917817 Maybe.
6192355000739551 Came here to have some fun, sawbones? Plague is a time for feasts.
6192355000904510 I have. I took care of him.
6192355000904511 I'm going there soon.
6192355000904517 I don't like your attitude, architect.
6192355000971458 Your brother, who is he?
6192355000904509 What a lout… Have you checked up on my brother yet?
6192355000904514 And you're not?
6192355000909360 You should stay inside. Just to be safe.
6192355000904513 Take good care of my brother, doctor. If I kick the bucket, so be it. But my brother must survive. He is a genius.
6192355000904516 Never been there.
6192355000904518 You built that?
6192355000904515 Sure am. Have you seen the Dancing Bridge in the Capital?
6192355000904520 It looks like an abscess.
6192355000909351 When it comes crashing down, it will bombard the Stone Yard with debris.
6192355000909352 It's one of yours too, I gather. How did you even come up with something like that?
6192355000904519 That's right. And the Polyhedron? What do you think?
6192355000909356 How does the ground even support something so large?
6192355000909355 Don't fret, it's not going to collapse any time soon. It's held for five years, and will survive at least five hundred more.
6192355000909358 I've always considered Earth to be the source of life.
6192355000909359 I just don't understand you idealistic maniacs.
6192355000909357 One must be able to think boldly. The ground is nothing but dirt. Nothing but soil hiding rotting corpses. It's the realm of the dead. \nWe've always wanted to create something that the earth cannot touch, cannot defile in any way.
6192355000909362 All in all, you seem healthy. The judge will be pleased.
6192355000909363 The local climate is good for twins.
6192355000909361 I am the battering ram that clears his path. Me and him are perfect twins.
6192355000917819 You know I'm not some handyman you have to bribe with booze?
6192355000917820 Keep it. The alcohol should keep the microbes at bay.
6192355000917821 Give me the bottle, and keep your compliments.
6192355000917818 Great job. Have a drink on me, then.
6192355000971453 Are you quoting something?
6192355000971454 …Something about touching. Can't remember the exact wording.
6192355000971452 "And this pestilence was the more virulent for that, by communication with those who were sick thereof, it gat hold upon the sound, no otherwise than fire upon things dry or greasy, whenas they are brought very near thereunto. Nay, the mischief was yet greater…" And why was that, I wonder?
6192355000971457 
6192355000971456 By all means. He is a heavenly man. He won't take care of himself.
6192355000971460 We'll be dead and forgotten way sooner than that.
6192355000971461 As if the point of living is being remembered after death…
6192355000971459 In a hundred years, the whole Town will be dead and forgotten, yet my brother's name will live in human memory. That's who he is.
6192355000770354 I do! Stop yelling at me.
6192355001439800 I don't.
6192355000770353 Well, mine was just murdered! My brother's, too! Murdered in cold blood!\nThat Tower was alive! Alive! And there won't ever be another one like it! Ever! Even Brother won't make one! Even I won't build one on this sorry earth! Do you understand? Do you?!
6192355001229452 Who?
6192355001427289 Fine. Have your drink. We'll get back to this tomorrow, when you're sober.
6192355001229451 …Are you an idiot? Or just hammered? Why would you spout such ridiculous lies? W安娜be Herostratus…
6192355001427288 Recently, yes.
6192355001439779 No.
6192355001427287 Have you ever lost everything?
6192355001427291 I do.
6192355001427292 Stop trying to provoke me. It won't work.
6192355001427290 Don't you see we're having a conversation here?
6192355001439781 Easy there, architect.
6192355001439784 I'm not gawking. I'm just looking.
6192355001439785 Listen, brother…
6192355001439780 Then why the fuck are you gawking at me like there's anything for us to talk about?
6192355001439783 …Yes. I could have.
6192355001439789 No, I couldn't have.
6192355001439782 布拉克. Just tell me one thing. Look me in the eye and say it. Could you have protected him? Could you have… saved him?
6192355001439787 Calm down!
6192355001439788 Shush… I misspoke.
6192355001439786 What did you say? "Brother"? Who the fuck gave you the right to call me brother?
6192355001439791 You're clearly not happy to see me.
6192355001439792 I wanted to… to apologize. For Peter.
6192355001439790 My fucking condolences! Happy now?
6192355001439794 What for?
6192355001439793 I'll find the fuckers. I'll spend the rest of my days searching. I'll tear that general's throat out with my bare hands… I'll get the 士官s who gave the order, and the ones who stood by and watched, and the 士兵s who manned the cannon, the ones who aimed it.
6192355001439796 No.
6192355001439797 …I'm not gonna answer that question.
6192355001439795 What for?! For the Tower. Have you ever lost a child?
6192355001439803 Good luck with that.
6192355001439799 安德烈, listen… Leave those thirty-two people alone. It… it was me. I did it.
6192355001439798 You have no idea, obviously. I can tell.\nThirty-two people will pay for it with their lives. I've counted. Military fuckers… I'll follow them first thing tomorrow.
6192355001439802 Me.
6192355001439804 No. It was the cannon. So melt it down and leave people alone.
6192355001439801 You?
6192355001252364 所以你私下认识审判官？
6192355001418281 Look for openings?
6192355001418282 They recruit children?
6192355001252363 She has a stump of an imagination. Not that she lacks it completely, you know? She's not talentless. That's what stings the worst.\nThe inquisition only takes the talented. They look for children with potential, and then teach them… to look for openings.
6192355001252366 You wouldn't even spare the Cathedral?
6192355001418292 为什么？ What does Peter have to do with her?
6192355001252365 If Peter were still alive, I'd drop that hideous Cathedral on her head for him. But now…
6192355001252368 Well… Perhaps she'll appreciate that you came to her voluntarily.
6192355001420051 Relax. She won't bite.
6192355001252367 I only hope the bitch doesn't touch Brother.
6192355001418284 Do you know her?
6192355001418290 I'm not that easy to claw.
6192355001418291 I'm not sure I agree about creators and critics.
6192355001418283 You can't be a creator and a critic at the same time. To create greatness, you must ignore the minutiae. Work in wide strokes.\nBut… 审判官s eat into everything, like vinegar, lingering on every detail. They find a blemish, a flaw, then claw at it until you're finished.
6192355001418286 你私下认识这位审判官吗？
6192355001418285 Sometimes.
6192355001418288 That doesn't count.
6192355001418289 I see…
6192355001418287 At one degree of separation.
6192355001563838 She must.
6192355001563841 No.
6192355001563837 You'll see. Do you think she'll appreciate our Polyhedron?
6192355001563840 Why do you hate her so much?
6192355001563839 I wasn't the one who built it. It was Farkhad, may his soul rest in peace.
6192355001563844 I wonder how you'd withstand an interrogation.
6192355001563845 You know… It's beginning to grow on me.
6192355001563843 Agreed.
6192355001591978 I wanted to give you this key.
6192355001591979 Nothing. I just wanted to… ah, forget it.
6192355001591977 What do you want from half a man?
6192355001591981 I don't know.
6192355001591982 是彼得的。 A girl gave it to me… She must have found it among his things.
6192355001591983 A secret.
6192355001591980 What's this?
6192355001591985 What does this key open?
6192355001591986 I'm sorry.
6192355001591987 A girl lives at his place now… but I'll take care of her myself. Don't worry.
6192355001591988 …
6192355001591984 ……
6192355001591990 …
6192355001591991 Don't be rude.
6192355001591989 Shut up.
6192355001591993 Will you tell me what this is all about?
6192355001591994 My condolences are sincere.
6192355001591992 Thank you. And shut up! Shove your condolences up your ass. I despise insincerity.\nI understand now. He knew everything. All these years. It's surreal…\nThank you. Now go.
6192355001591996 Fair enough. I won't pry.
6192355001591997 You know, that girl… 格蕾丝. She can touch the dead with her mind. If the 格里夫 becomes unbearable, you may consider paying her a visit.
6192355001591995 No.

6192355001258351 安德烈·斯塔马丁
6192355000740153 I'm getting exhausted.
6192355000814123 It's not your blood.
6192355000814124 This blood belongs to everyone.
6192355000740152 This is our blөөd, tangher. Little of it left here, inside. Six springs. Six gulps. We will not allow үүou to drink our blөөd.
6192355000740155 I'm human.
6192355000814128 I <i>am</i> like you.
6192355000740154 Bite kharaan, it is so. Yes. For you are not like us.
6192355000740157 Whose blood is it, Khatangher?
6192355000814133 I know. It's an old legend.
6192355000740156 But we are beasts. We are Worms. Do you know that we are 虫人within Earth?
6192355000740159 You're an akhar! To you, I'm an emshen.
6192355000740160 Give me a sip.
6192355000740158 It's Mother Boddho's blөөd. She feeds us with her breast. Listen.\nCan үүou hear the pulse? This is the pulse of her veins, akhar.
6192355000814126 I feel like I'm dying without it.
6192355000814127 If I have a gulp, maybe I <i>will</i> become part of you.
6192355000814125 Why would an emshen need shoohan, living blөөd? You do not knөөw what to do with it.\nOur blөөd is shared. You are not part of us. You are different. Your blөөd is different.
6192355000814130 A yargachin.
6192355000814131 An emshen.
6192355000814132 Mes zasliin emch.
6192355000814129 Tsoe she daa? Who are үүou?
6192355000740151 Blood-Kin
6192355000730852 …I shouldn't have gone to bed at all.
6192355000730853 I need to rest.
6192355000730851 You're quite the sleeper, human.
6192355000730855 This isn't life.
6192355000730856 Life is a dream.
6192355000730854 Exactly. You'll sleep your whole life away, if you're not careful. "Time and tide tarry for no man," remember? Quality proverb.
6192355000730858 I'm not easily shaken, little critter. See, here I am, talking to you like all this is normal.
6192355000730859 No one waits for me, not here.
6192355000730857 While you dream, the Town lives. Someone out there waits for you, this very moment. Perhaps they wait in vain. Is my hint clear? Don't be surprised if you wake up and find every train has left the Station.

6192355001374196 
6192355000753552 Who?
6192355000753551 I rise. No one can stop me now. And you can do nothing against me. I am taking them all.
6192355000753554 为什么？
6192355001514115 Like hell! I won't let you have them!
6192355000753553 All in your care. All you care for.\nThey wish it, you know. Worry not. Children have better odds than grown men. Much better.
6192355000753557 You're not omnipotent. I have a weapon against you.
6192355001519898 What do you mean, "overcome death"? You <i>are</i> death!
6192355000753555 I come to teach the folk how to overcome death. And children are the most striking of your kind. They can do more than their mothers and 父亲s.
6192355000753559 They do. They're leaking out. But I know what that flow comes from, now.
6192355001514116 Yes… You are a wonder, too. "Plague, monsters, and wonders." Such is our tragedy.
6192355000753558 You have no weapon. You mean your "panacea," all-heal, yes? What good is such a draught a world bereft of the stuff to craft it? Wonders flee this world, 布拉克. I am one of dwindling few. You fail to ken it yet.
6192355000753561 Even children managed to make a cure for you. Five years ago. "Schmowders…"
6192355000753560 I have heard such before.
6192355000753563 I will save some. At least that. To prove you're not all-powerful.
6192355000753564 A doctor's victory isn't about saving everyone, but about creating a cure. Which I have.
6192355000753565 Everyone on my list will survive. I remember my duty.
6192355001519906 What tidings?
6192355000753562 Indeed? You are welcome to seek them out. But I reckon you will find no children in the streets these days.\nKnow you the newest tidings, man of fog? Lend me an ear, then, to what I tell you!
6192355001519896 I have a weapon against you.
6192355001519897 Why do you do it? Why the kids…?
6192355001519895 I wonder how you think to stop me.
6192355001519900 I won't let you experiment on us like that.
6192355001519901 What makes you think the kids want this transformation?
6192355001519899 Untrue! I am not the same as death. I am but a test of menfolk's ken and prowess to overcome their bounds. And of all known bounds, death is the greatest tangle.\nThat you will die is naught but a belief… Worms, halfmen, so far from overmen!
6192355001519903 I won't let you have them.
6192355001519902 They do! And if they don't, they will. That is the path your 父亲 set for them. That's why your "list" bears their names. The Town's future. The yest to make it rise. 
6192355001519905 Even children managed to make a cure for you. Five years ago. "Schmowders…"
6192355001519904 I am both fiend and wonder, true.\nStop, 布拉克. You can't bring them back. It is beyond your power. You know not what I am; so how can you stop my reach? You can't guard them. You can't stop this.
6192355001519908 So mine are the last…
6192355001519909 No, wonder-creature. They are mine.
6192355001519910 A town with no future. This is it, then.
6192355001519907 Block had all the young ones taken away. They've been crammed into a train and sent away while you daydreamed.\nFew are left. Your wards… My wards, now. The Town that used to be ruled by children has been left childless.\nWhat a thought…
6192355000738251 
6192355000738652 
6192355000738663 
6192355000741152 
6192355000741173 Tie what together?
6192355000822480 Sure, just give me a rope.
6192355000741172 Go ahead. Tie it together.
6192355000741175 It doesn't take exceptional wisdom to see connections.
6192355000822491 But I've got nothing on me.
6192355000741174 You ask me? The ones that fit together. A menkhu sees the connections between.
6192355000822479 What things?
6192355000822483 All you need to do is place them close to one another.
6192355000822484 It's people who connect things. Touch one, then another—and a connection forms.
6192355000822478 Show us if you are a good menkhu, emshen. Show us you know how to connect things.
6192355000822482 What do I need to connect? And where?
6192355000822481 The emshen is modest. It takes no wisdom to see that a cord connects mother to child, yes. It takes no wisdom to see that a stone falling into a river connects to the ripples on the surface. \nBut to see the connection between the stone and the mother? It does nenpa gu dzom, emshen.
6192355000822486 With a glance. Just the way you like it.
6192355000822487 With a thought, obviously. Real connections are formed in the mind.
6192355000822488 With a hand, of course.
6192355000822485 Touch them how?
6192355000822490 But I need… I need herbs, roots. Where can I get them?
6192355000822495 I'll have to work on this stone slab?
6192355000822489 Here, on these rocks. You know how it works. A table to cut and mix.
6192355000822493 No. I know what to do.
6192355000822494 Yes.
6192355000822492 Take what you find around. Should we wait for you?
6192355000822497 I can't brew much on it.
6192355000822496 Yes.

6192355000743252 
6192355000743253 
6192355000743452 So what now? I guess I could get some sleep?
6192355000743453 How can you tell which events are of consequence?
6192355000743454 Thanks for the warning, pal.
6192355000743451 You are too quick, kind sir! You pace ahead of schedule like a man possessed. Let's see: The next event of consequence is set to come into your life… Tonight. Later.
6192355000743456 Oh, I know. An ill tide.
6192355000743457 Fair advice.
6192355000743455 Why sleep? So much to do! So little time! \nIf you can find an hour or two to spare, then make the most you can of precious time. For bitter Fate demands that you prepare: Explore the town and fill your pockets, quick! Your time is short, and no one knows what tide tomorrow brings.
6192355000743459 So do I just sit around and nap until evening?
6192355000743458 I was a fortune-teller's own assistant. Though some thought him a fraud, I saw behind the curtain, awed at all I witnessed there.\nSo trust me when I say: There's time enough for you, 布拉克. For now, at least, there's time.
6192355000783954 Off-Hour 提词人
6192355000745259 你想要什么？
6192355000814100 为什么？
6192355000814118 我是个医生。卫生检查。你们当中有感染者吗？
6192355000745258 闪一边去。
6192355000814099 国家审判官。
6192355000814101 我的老婆。
6192355000814106 不关你的事。
6192355000814098 和你同行的是谁？
6192355000814103 远离此地。
6192355000814107 旅游观光而已。
6192355000814108 我们奉布洛克将军命令行事。
6192355000814102 目的地？
6192355000814110 或许我们可以做个交易，中尉？
6192355000814111 好，好。你们赢了。我们这就回去。
6192355000814112 审判官完成了她在这里的职责。她正在返回首都。我是她的护卫。
6192355000814109 喂，在这里！你们等什么！抓住她！
6192355000814114 不，我们现在就说。
6192355000814115 我是个医生，这里有人生病了吗？
6192355000814116 好，我等。
6192355000814113 站一边去，我等会儿再和你说话。
6192355000745261 为什么…?
6192355000814121 你以为你不怕死吗…?
6192355000745260 我们当中没有感染者。你可以走了，医生。回镇子里去。
6192355000814120 …
6192355000814122 你看不到明天的太阳了。
6192355000814119 Quarantine breach. And there was a special order regarding the 审判官.\nAs I said, you're free to go. The Town is to the north. I won't repeat myself a third time.
6192355000817751 
6192355000819251 士官
6192355001387256 你他妈是谁？
6192355001393158 你是个… 信使? 审判官的信呢?
6192355001469556 It's not. You look nothing like me.
6192355001387255 The resemblance is striking.
6192355001393160 A new actor is only hired when the old one's dead. Or has this rule changed?
6192355001393166 I don't need successors. I'll manage on my own.
6192355001393159 I'm a new actor. Your successor, so to speak. A continuation of you.
6192355001393162 "阿泰米"? What the hell?
6192355001393161 No. I'm not a courier, I'm 阿泰米. Though I have seen the guy. Almost got him.
6192355001393168 What are your skills?
6192355001469572 Paid in advance… and here I am, working for free.
6192355001393167 It's all very confusing now. The director washed his hands of this whole business, said we're on our own. No script at all. \nBut I got paid in advance, so here I am. Doing the work I'm supposed to do.
6192355001393170 I do. But I prefer to make them myself.
6192355001393171 What kind of connection?
6192355001498853 I haven't been to the river yet.
6192355001393169 I embarked on your path in advance to make sure the thread doesn't snap. I walked in your footsteps. I've been to the river, spoken with the 换生灵, seen the 士兵s in the fog. What have you done to them, by the way? Did you shoot, or run?\nAnyway… I don't hinder you at all. But I <i>have</i> made a new connection. You love connections, don't you?
6192355001393173 Playing? Are you kidding? I'm the real thing. The actual person. The one and only.
6192355001393174 Defeated what? You hardly look like a conqueror.
6192355001393172 You and I are connected. Both alive. Both playing the same person simultaneously. That means we've defeated it. What's so bad about that?
6192355001393178 Where's the courier? Were you after him?
6192355001393177 Like I said, I'm your successor. If you die, I'll continue in your place. Seriously, I'm starting to think I understand the director's vision better than you do.
6192355001393180 Couldn't even do that right, 阿泰米 布拉克?
6192355001393181 Tell me your name.
6192355001393179 Hell if I know. He wanted to live, so he ran. Understandable, really.
6192355001393183 You're talking like I'm not still here. <i>And</i> you're bad at it!
6192355001469589 Great job shifting the guilt.
6192355001469590 Your arms ought to be torn from their sockets. You're an impostor—if only because I still live!
6192355001469591 I don't need a <i>successor.</i> Don't replace, duplicate, or cover for me. I'm the only person named 阿泰米 布拉克, the only one with his burden. You're not <i>here.</i>
6192355001393182 I couldn't finish him off. My arms are weak. You never got the hang of this whole fighting thing. I have to pay for that, since I'm your successor.\nNo hard feelings, though. I guess doctors don't really need that skill. But if you were a better fighter, the courier wouldn't be on the run now…
6192355001393185 No. This world isn't big enough for us both.
6192355001469587 I think I'm starting to understand… Fine. Succeed me. I wonder how it'll end.
6192355001469588 <i>I'll</i> be the one to succeed <i>you.</i> And now I'm off to find the courier.
6192355001393184 I am 伊西多 Gasar. I follow in 阿泰米·布拉克's footsteps, trying my best to study him. That's all I want. So, can we go our separate ways?
6192355001469555 I don't get it.
6192355001469566 I don't <i>want</i> a successor. I'm not over yet.
6192355001469567 Huh… I see. Well, hello, 阿泰米·布拉克.
6192355001469554 我是你的继承者。
6192355001469558 <i>I'm</i> the real thing.
6192355001469559 What are you doing here?
6192355001469557 I'm talking about myself. The resemblance is striking. It's like I'm the real thing.
6192355001469561 So, is he here?
6192355001469565 你是谁, man? Why do you call yourself 布拉克?
6192355001469560 I was looking for the courier. Same as you. Today is the day, in which the Haruspex looks for the courier.
6192355001469563 Where. Is. The courier?
6192355001469586 Your directions were misleading. That's not what I'm planning to do.
6192355001469562 My stage directions went like this: "Today, the Haruspex looks for the courier." 布拉克 tries to ambush him, so that he doesn't deliver orders to the general. \nSo I tried to kill him, and failed.
6192355001469570 Why argue? I only need to wink to those guys over there, and they'll cut you to pieces.
6192355001469571 Then explain. And keep it brief.
6192355001469569 We can talk about <i>that.</i>
6192355001469574 Fair enough…
6192355001469575 The thing is, I don't <i>like</i> you. Your performance is terrible. I'm completely different.
6192355001469573 Leave me be, human. I'll be of use to you yet. I stand between you and Death, as your successor.
6192355001469577 Even your speech patterns are different!
6192355001469578 I'm sure.
6192355001469576 Are you sure? Who knows. It never hurts to take a good look at yourself.
6192355001469580 What?
6192355001469581 I don't want this. I'll manage on my own.
6192355001469579 I succeed you. Don't hurt me, human. I'm your mirror. Don't kill me. I'm your guide to immortality. As you die, I'll succeed you.
6192355001469583 Blah blah.
6192355001469584 All right. Let's play at fate, then. Where's the courier?
6192355001469582 Fate.
6192355001498855 I'm not <i>forgetting the script!</i> I made a choice. I <i>chose</i> to come here first!
6192355001498856 How can you "succeed" me if we're both here at the same time?
6192355001498854 Running late? Forgetting the script?\nThat's fine. <i>I've</i> been there. I succeed you. Today is the day in which the Haruspex looks for the courier.
6192355001498858 I chose a different path than you. That means we're different.
6192355001498857 You made a choice. Yes. Choice is a connection, too. Existence and nonexistence go hand in hand. It doesn't matter if you went left or right; what matters is that you've been to the crossroads.\nYou chose to choose.
6192355000785351 阿泰米·布拉克
6192355000821529 Yeah? And who'll take pity on <i>me?</i>
6192355001469624 Beshe, I refuse. I cannot do it your way.
6192355001469625 Before the eyes of Kin and Earth, this I say: son of Mother Boddho之子, will not harm her. The Sky is my witness.
6192355000745274 Take pity on us, essegher. Kill not our mother.
6192355000821533 I see…
6192355000821547 No. I don't want to inhabit an earth that would do <i>this</i> to humans.
6192355000821532 Mother Boddho is full of living blood. She forms us from her body. We live, as long as she lives. She lives, as long as steaming blood flows through her.
6192355000821539 …And Sand Pest.
6192355000821546 What are you getting at?
6192355000821538 Brides caress Earth with their feet. 虫人dwell in it. The throatless emerge from soil whenever Earth wants people to hear her.
6192355000821541 But which of us is the child and which is the parent?
6192355000821540 You went the wrong way, emshen. You stumble through the wrong path. Be khara, you know not what you look for.\nThe sand pest is the scream of Mother Boddho. We are her murmur. Now, she murmurs lovingly to you, like an infant.
6192355000821543 I'll have to kill <i>someone.</i>
6192355000821544 I understand.
6192355000821545 Yes… I do pity you. More humans will be born, but your kind is irreplaceable.
6192355000821542 We run out of words, essegher. Out of sounds. Hard to speak. Throatless, tongueless! Wordless.\nPlease take pity on our mother yours-and-mine, essegher. Kill us not. Boleesh, boleesh, byy alysh…
6192355000821549 It's tough for everyone.
6192355001469630 Earth bore this terrible plague.
6192355000821548 Don't humans do worse by her? Why do they pierce her? Why do they build unbearable towns upon her body? She is so terribly burdened. Her ribs crack under this town's weight. It may be small, but it is heavier than many.
6192355001469593 I can't help it. This sacrifice must be made.
6192355001469596 What are you talking about?
6192355001469619 That's the opposite of what I want.
6192355001469592 You need her blood. If you let blood out of Earth, Mother Boddho will die. Is that what you want? Boleesh, boleesh, byy alysh…
6192355001469595 I pity you. Pity the weak and the doomed. It's a pity when the last aurochs goes extinct…
6192355001469620 Earth is killing us. Mother Boddho devours her children. She disgorged this horrible plague, so her blood will erase it. All is connected. All is as it should be.
6192355001469594 If Mother Boddho dies, so do we. Zobolon, boozarlakhaa. It hurts! It frightens us. So few remain. It is not so terrible to die, but what about losing something for all time?
6192355001469598 Sayn baina, Khatanghe. What do you want to tell me?
6192355001469599 …I've heard these words before. What duty is it now?
6192355001469600 你是谁, bizarre creatures…?
6192355001469597 Waiting for you. Waiting for you. Tell us, tell us now: Will you fulfill your duty?
6192355001469602 Like shabnak-adyg…
6192355001469603 I thought this was just a dream.
6192355001499752 你想要什么？
6192355001469601 We are made of Earth. Mother Boddho feeds us living blood. Suok watches us from the depths.
6192355001469606 What is she waiting for?
6192355001469613 But… I'm nobody.
6192355001469605 Your words were for your 父亲, then. Now, speak for your mother. Mother Boddho, Earth, awaits you.
6192355001469608 What do you fear?
6192355001469611 I know. There are few of you left.
6192355001469612 I'm not sorry for you.
6192355001469607 Bite kharan, ubshe stands at our doorstep. A big loss. All that remains of us is here, before you.
6192355001469616 Why me? You are doomed. You are the past. You will inevitably die, ground down by time.
6192355001469621 I really need that blood.
6192355001469622 This is beyond me. I'm a doctor, responsible for the Town. It is in agony, but something can still be saved.
6192355001499753 I do.
6192355001469615 Take pity on us.
6192355001469618 What do you want from me?
6192355001469623 I pity you. I truly pity you.
6192355001469617 Be khara, emshen chooses words carefully. Who is to judge him? But, but, take pity on us.
6192355001469627 Bayatay, Khatanghe. Oshysh daa. Go.
6192355001469628 Go. I still have time to think.
6192355001469629 Don't worry. I've changed my mind. I… I'll never betray you.
6192355001469626 Then this is our goodbye. Bayatay, emshen. Bayatay, essegher. Bayatay, kholboön. Bayatay, khayaala.
6192355000785353 Boddho's Murmur
6192355000745281 You mean… her? The 换生灵?
6192355001451508 But you will fire in either case?
6192355001451509 How can she promise that?
6192355001652993 That was one compelling discussion of war, then.
6192355000745280 …I need only <i>technically</i> execute the order. All I need is a precise target designated by the state commissar. If I have that, I can legally spare the Town.\nThank this girl. She promised me the epidemic wouldn't spread past the Town. And I believe her.
6192355001410658 Yes.
6192355001410657 Did you come to hand me the papers designating the bombardment target? The justification for a surgical strike, signed by the state 审判官?
6192355001419652 Yes, sir.
6192355001419653 …I don't feel free at all. My fate drives me.
6192355001419651 Thank you. You are free to go.
6192355001451502 So there will be a bombardment?
6192355001451503 So this is what you are like, General Ashes.
6192355001451501 Even if you have found a source of raw material for your serum, it's too late now. We'll execute the order and leave for the front. That's it.
6192355001451505 But you'll have to fire anyway, right?
6192355001451515 In that case, I have something for you…
6192355001451504 Yes.
6192355001451507 So there is nothing to discuss here.
6192355001451516 The 审判官 has done the calculations.
6192355001451506 If the target is designated, I'll have to.
6192355001451511 I am.
6192355001451512 What has she done to you? I can't believe my ears…
6192355001451510 She can. I trust her. Are you here on business, or what?
6192355001451514 I am here on the 审判官's behalf…
6192355001451513 Do you seriously believe I intend to discuss this with you? State your business and be done with it.
6192355001451518 Waiting.
6192355001451519 It's all decided. What else is there to talk about?
6192355001451517 And, 布拉克? Wait a second.
6192355001451521 Take 丹考夫斯基.
6192355001451522 I thought about it. Thank you. I'll catch up with you after I finish my business here.
6192355001451523 Take 鲁宾. That's his cup of tea. He's a natural-born 士兵.
6192355001451524 No.
6192355001451520 Come with us. We need an experienced doctor.
6192355001652995 I am.
6192355001652996 What has she done to you? I can't believe my ears…
6192355001652994 Are you here on business, or what?
6192355001449170 I'm 一个外科医生。 阿泰米 布拉克.
6192355001451451 I'm a doctor who's making a cure for this plague.
6192355001451452 布拉克, doctor. At your service.
6192355001449169 I'm listening.
6192355001451454 Briefly? None.
6192355001451455 There are four doctors in town. 丹考夫斯基, a theorist; a girl who performs miracles; 鲁宾, a forensic specialist; and me, 一个外科医生。 That's all.
6192355001591251 There are three doctors in town. 丹考夫斯基, a theorist; a girl who performs miracles; and me, 一个外科医生。 That's all.
6192355001451456 I have a recipe for a serum, but it's useless.
6192355001451453 Ah, I remember now. You were in the report. What means are currently at our disposal to combat the outbreak? Briefly, please.
6192355001451458 No.
6192355001451471 I have a recipe for a serum. Based on traditional medicine, so to speak.
6192355001451457 Anything to add?
6192355001451460 Blood of an unknown creature, most likely an animal.
6192355001451461 Of an unknown creature. But it's warm and living, which means the creature is living, too—and it's close!
6192355001591252 I'm not sure… but it comes from below the ground.
6192355001451459 What kind of blood does it require?
6192355001451463 I don't know. I'm looking for it!
6192355001451464 I think it's a bull. A special kind of bull. Call it intuition…
6192355001571251 I never thought you were a believer, General.
6192355001451462 What kind of creature? A brontosaurus? A phoenix? Or, hmm, what else… An angel of God?
6192355001451467 Not in these conditions.
6192355001451468 问丹考夫斯基去。
6192355001451466 Can your cure be reproduced chemically?
6192355001451470 Crystal clear.
6192355001451488 One beats the bush, and <i>seven others</i> catch the bird…
6192355001451469 Listen, 布拉克. Am I saying it right? "布拉克"?\nOur unit has no medical personnel. We were sent here <i>butt naked.</i> I'll figure out later if it was insanity, negligence, or a premeditated crime… but right now, we need you to give us everything you have. Do I make myself clear?
6192355001451473 It requires blood of an… unknown nature.
6192355001451474 I don't know where to get the raw material for it.
6192355001451472 Go on.
6192355001451476 It leaves no survivors.
6192355001451475 Blood of previously-infected survivors?
6192355001451478 Correct.
6192355001451487 Just call me by my last name.
6192355001591256 Those aren't tall tales!
6192355001451477 Don't give me those tall tales… what was it… 布拉克? 阿泰米 布拉克, correct?
6192355001451482 All blood seeps from Olonngo.
6192355001451483 I guess the 审判官 could solve this problem.
6192355001591257 I have a sample.
6192355001591263 I don't know.
6192355001451481 How can we find the source of this blood?
6192355001451485 I have a sample.
6192355001451486 I'm a doctor, not an investigator.
6192355001591268 I know where to look… but I don't yet understand how it will help.
6192355001451484 审判官s only ever solve their own problems, never anyone else's. Whatever they tell you, their real agendas are inscrutable. Don't let them fool you. They're just parasites, making others do their dirty work. The only well-being they care about is their own.\nAny more ideas?
6192355001451492 What?
6192355001451493 You're a general. Who could order… ah, never mind.
6192355001451491 You no longer work in the hospital. Your only job is to find the raw material for the serum, in sufficient quantities to protect the Town. I don't need samples, or some proof-of-concept—I need a train car <i>full</i> of your cure.\nIf we don't find it in two days, I will have to bombard the Town. Those are my orders. Do I make myself clear?
6192355001451495 Yes. I have a question…
6192355001451496 No.
6192355001451494 Let them burn in hell! But orders are orders. We're military, 布拉克. We don't debate orders.\nThe extreme lethality and unclear origin of your disease demands the full destruction of your town as a transport junction and settlement. We must create an exclusion zone. Do I make myself clear?
6192355001451498 I don't feel free…
6192355001451499 It was nice meeting the jewel of our military.
6192355001451500 If you ask so nicely… General Ashes.
6192355001451497 Dismissed.\nYou're under an obligation to report to the headquarters immediately if summoned, and to carry out any order I give you. The Army commissions you. For now, your goal is to find the missing serum component—in significant quantities.\nThat's it. You're free to go.
6192355001571253 What do you mean?
6192355001571254 Yeah… the way things are going, we don't have much left besides faith.
6192355001571252 I wasn't until yesterday.
6192355001591254 …I can't. I don't know. I'm not yet sure that my eyes haven't deceived me.
6192355001591253 Explain.
6192355001591259 How much blood do I have? Too little.
6192355001591260 A droplet.
6192355001591258 How much?
6192355001591262 …I haven't really figured it out myself yet.
6192355001591261 What does that mean?

6192355000764351 士兵
6192355000764360 Ours.
6192355001471177 I'm a doctor. You know what they say: "Everyone's on their own, and only God is on everyone's side."
6192355000764359 Which side are you on?
6192355001526492 为什么？
6192355001526493 If only you could all finish each other off even faster.
6192355001526491 See how it is here… Fucking trigger-happy idiots. Fucking morons, shooting our own…
6192355001526495 Calm down.
6192355001526496 A split? Tell me more.
6192355001532751 So you're fighting amongst yourselves now… A true outbreak. Worse than the pest…
6192355001526494 There's a… split. Some follow the general, others follow Longin—the executive 士官.\nWhat do you want here? Can't you see we're done for? Huh? <i>Huh?</i>
6192355001526498 Calm down. I'm leaving.
6192355001526499 I'm a doctor. Put away the gun. Away, I said! There, I'm leaving.
6192355001526497 …Hands up! I said, raise your hands, now!
6192355000764352 士兵
6192355000766260 阿泰米·布拉克, doctor. Where's General Block?
6192355000766258 Name?
6192355000766262 I'm a doctor. Let me examine the general.
6192355001534957 Stop lying, will you? Tell me straight—what kind of circus is going on here?
6192355000766261 The general is sick. The provisional executive 士官 is Captain Longin.
6192355000766264 How did he manage to catch it, I wonder? He was here, in the headquarters! There was no plague around here yesterday. And it needs at least a day before it shows…
6192355001526501 You paper-pusher… Wake up! I'm a <i>doctor!</i>
6192355001534958 Where's the general? I'd like to examine him and prescribe treatment.
6192355000766263 General Block is out sick. Captain Longin is now in charge of the quarantine measures. You can try your luck with him when he's back.
6192355001499552 What do you think you're doing?!
6192355001526504 What? Children were evacuated?
6192355001499551 He caught it while evacuating everyone under the age of sixteen.
6192355001499556 I don't like this at all. Does the commissar, 阿格莱雅·莉莉奇, know about this?
6192355001534964 But the general isn't.
6192355001499555 The door is over there, doctor.
6192355001499558 I'm not one of your junior 士官s… lieutenant.
6192355001499559 You people are dousing fire with kerosene.
6192355001499557 Over. There.
6192355001526503 Got it.
6192355001534963 I cure everyone who is in need. I can help him too. I have the medicine! You hear me?
6192355001526502 …Show me your teeth one more time, and you'll carry them home in your pocket. Got it?
6192355001526506 But how…
6192355001526505 Every one of them we could. This morning.
6192355001526508 …I've heard about him.
6192355001526509 No… but… no.
6192355001526507 The general assigned several train cars and an artillery engine. That's the kind of man he is.
6192355001534954 Urgent.
6192355001534955 I have an appointment.
6192355001534956 I want to report my progress with the curative serum.
6192355001534953 State your business.
6192355001534960 Wait. How did the general get infected?
6192355001534961 You're a bad liar. Now tell me what you've done to him!
6192355001534962 Quarantined how? The whole fucking Town is infected!
6192355001534959 I'm not authorized to divulge that information. The general is quarantined, and attended to. You can go.

6192355001313851 士官
6192355000851704 I thought you'd ask how I got into this coffin…
6192355000851705 And just 你是谁？
6192355001419851 Yes. It's been a rough September.
6192355000851703 September's been rough this year.
6192355000851707 An eternal one, looks like.
6192355000851708 I've figured out who you are.
6192355000851706 Your companion.
6192355000851710 Survived… death? Is this some kind of joke?
6192355000851711 So I'm going to live forever now?
6192355000851712 …Only survivor?
6192355000851709 You survived death. This is your victory. You're the only survivor.
6192355000851714 So how <i>do</i> you defeat death?
6192355001419852 Why defeat it?
6192355001419859 Sounds nice, but it doesn't hold up. The common cold can sometimes kill a person.
6192355000851713 Why does the disease kill some, but not others? After all, it seemed like everyone could have fallen seriously, terminally ill.\nMaybe it's the same with death in general. We think it obliterates everyone. But if you act just so, your intellect can overcome death—just as your body overcomes plague or typhus!
6192355000851716 Maybe I will.
6192355000851717 I don't think so. You bore me.
6192355000851715 Maybe. If you wanted to.
6192355000851719 Goodbyes? What's the point?
6192355000851720 Goodbyes? What's the point?
6192355000851721 How does one <i>survive</i> death?
6192355000851718 Or maybe you're not the only one… I don't know how many you've managed to touch. Or will manage to.\nYou still have the entire rest of the day to share your goodbyes with whomever you wish, to touch a last few souls.
6192355000851723 If not immortality, then what? Where's the answer?
6192355001419860 A boundary… Good word.
6192355000851722 By realizing that death is not a vanishing. It's a boundary. You can step over any chasm if you're convinced it's just another obstacle.\nIt's naive to think victory over death means immortality. Immortality is tiring if you remain who you are. Much more so if you fall into decline.
6192355000851725 And what exactly <i>have</i> I done to the Town?
6192355000851724 What have you done to the Town? And what has the Town done to you?\nYou wouldn't have been able to solve this problem without each other, different creatures as you are. An enormous town, a small person, an undetectably minuscule microbe. Three of you. You needed each other.
6192355000851727 As if the Town cared whether I understood it or not…
6192355000851726 You understood it. You bound its severed parts together. Drawing new connections between things that seemed incompatible—that is the essence of understanding. To understand is to become someone else.\nWhat seemed like death to the former you is just a crack in the earth for the new you. It's still rather wide, but you can get across.
6192355000851729 What's going to happen to its inhabitants?
6192355000851728 You took pity on your town. You went where love led you. You decided the last of the miraculous creatures must not be deprived of their lives. You realized the plague itself was alive. You cherish everything alive.\nLook—the Town is grateful to you. It has changed.
6192355000851731 Can we do without that?
6192355000851730 You've given your town a future. You've weaned it from the earth, and that's something. The nourishing umbilical cord must be severed at some point.
6192355000851733 Thank you, 同行的旅人. It matters.
6192355000851734 Yes. I should say farewell.
6192355000851732 I don't know. I'm letting them go, you hear? I'm officially waiving my claim to them. Go say goodbye. They want to say goodbye to you, too.
6192355000851739 Not my kind of freedom. There's something… wrong, about all of this.
6192355000851740 I'll just say my goodbyes.
6192355000851738 The people will become free. They'll discover their destinies within the Town, and those destinies will shape it. They'll think of death how you've grown to think of death. Whoever survives something like this has nothing to fear.\nGo say goodbye to them.
6192355001419854 Well, maybe…
6192355001419855 You know, 同行的旅人? You should talk to my new friend. His name's 学者 丹考夫斯基. Really big on the whole "fighting death" thing.
6192355001419853 Life's more interesting this way.
6192355001419857 Every other person is smarter than me here…
6192355001419858 Just be careful around him. He's a fussy sort of person… Delicate.
6192355001419856 Oh, I know. I'll get to him right after I've finished with you. He's smarter than you are.
6192355001419862 So… What now?
6192355001419863 I'm stupid. I have no talent. I… should never have even come here.
6192355001419861 It <i>is</i> good.
6192355001419865 To the heart of the Town. The central square. To, I don't know… the Theatre. I don't have much of a choice.
6192355001419864 Where will you go then?
6192355001419867 I see.
6192355001419868 It's true. I'm no one.
6192355001419869 You know what? I actually like myself. I've walked my path well these past eleven days. I can respect myself.
6192355001419866 Don't worry. You'll have a choice there.\nBesides, you've already done all you can. All that's left is… a bit of business to wrap up. Things that concern you alone. And you… 你是谁？ Who cares about you?
6192355001288968 Where are we going, exactly?
6192355001427624 Hang on. We're going back!
6192355001427627 How are we suddenly inseparable?
6192355001288967 There. I've reaped my harvest. Off we go, the two of us… into the wider world. We're inseparable now, my 同行的旅人.
6192355001427626 Who <i>are</i> you, 同行的旅人?
6192355001427628 Why are you clinging to me, huh? What do you want from me?
6192355001427625 To the great expanse, where the real life is. Where there's real work waiting. For both you and me… It's going to be much more interesting.
6192355001427630 So I'm the reason you're going back into the world?
6192355001427631 I really could've shaken you off? Buried you there?
6192355001427632 Plentiful…?
6192355001427629 Wherever you are, there I am. That's how it's going to be now. Back in town, you could've shaken me off… You had the chance. A once-in-a-lifetime chance. But you didn't.\nWise choice. Now you're going to have to put up with me until the end. And not just you… Like I said, there, in the great expanse, the harvest will be more plentiful.
6192355001427634 Well, now that we're inseparable, I'm going to hold you tight, so you don't escape.
6192355001427635 I don't believe you. You're lying. And I'm never going to believe you.
6192355001427633 You bet.
6192355001427637 Real, huh? Well… we'll see.
6192355001427638 I'm sick of your chatter. Since we're stuck together forever, you might as well shut up for a while, you leech.
6192355001427639 Let me get some sleep. At least you won't be in my dreams, Companion.
6192355001427636 That's what I was talking about… Of <i>course</i> there will be work for you. For me, collecting my dues. For you, holding me back, if you so decide. You <i>are</i> a doctor, aren't you? A notorious lover of people.\nSo we'll both have jobs to do. Forever. Where we're returning to, it won't be fun and games anymore… I'm telling you, it's real life!

6192355000770477 [a living heart of a giant creature]
6192355000770480 Talk to me.
6192355000770479 [it's beating… barely]
6192355000770482 You're the udurgh.
6192355000770481 …To me. [I've been talking to you this whole time.]
6192355000770484 You are the Town's heart, yes?
6192355000770485 You are the voice of Earth. No?
6192355000770486 Are Earth and the Town one and the same? Do you know?
6192355000770483 …Udurgh. [I don't know this word.]
6192355000770488 Am I talking to myself again? I tend to do that. Yes…
6192355000770487 …No.
6192355000770490 The Town is alive.
6192355000770489 …Yes.
6192355000770492 You're just an echo.
6192355000770493 No. You're not just an echo.
6192355000770491 …Alive.
6192355000770470 
6192355001503566 Zurkhen's Big Chamber
6192355001387254 Hey, you there! Grab him, and get ready to hold him down if he struggles.
6192355001451781 Boil water. Lots of it.
6192355001451782 Get me all the bandages you can. Rip up all the cloth you can find to make more.
6192355001451783 Get me the longest set of tweezers from the bag.
6192355001387253 [I don't have much experience with gunshot wounds. Common sense says I can't get the bullet out safely in these conditions... but I know the Lines. Or, at least, I think I do.]
6192355001451785 [Wash my hands]
6192355001451786 [Sterilize my tools]
6192355001451787 [Get my hands on some alcohol, preferably not the drinking kind]
6192355001451788 [Cut off the clothing, it obstructs the wound]
6192355001451784 [He was shot in the stomach. That's bad news, he is almost a goner. The wounded is wearing a sweater and several shirts at once. Guess he was hoping the layers of cloth will protect him from sand pest.]
6192355001451790 [Wash the wound with water]
6192355001451791 [Clean the wound with alcohol]
6192355001451792 [Strap his torso with cloth, both above and below the wound]
6192355001451793 [Strap his torso below the wound]
6192355001451794 [Strap his ribs with cloth]
6192355001451789 [The wound doesn't look good at all. A ricocheting rifle round, by the looks of it. But I feel like he has a chance.]
6192355001451796 [Search the wound with tweezers. Gently now...]
6192355001451797 [Make a few incisions at the edge of the wound]
6192355001451798 [Calm the patient down. With my left hand, firmly immobilize his head]
6192355001451795 [The patient's breath gets hoarse, he is gurgling and wheezing.]
6192355001451800 [Time to drain the wound... With some cleaner cloth]
6192355001451803 Someone knock him out already! He's flailing around!
6192355001451804 [Gently pull the wound wider apart]
6192355001451805 [Quickly drain the blood with clumped bandages, it's impossible to see!]
6192355001451799 [It looks like the wound is less dangerous than it first seemed. The bullet didn't go in deep enough to do major damage. However, the wound is contaminated with pieces of dirty cloth.]
6192355001451802 Okay, buddy, calm down. We can get through this.
6192355001451801 [Shouldn't have done that! He is wheezing and struggling even harder. There is still a chance]
6192355001451807 [Something small. A bone fragment...? I don't think so, not in the stomach!]
6192355001451808 [Pull it out, whatever it is]
6192355001451809 [No time for dawdling]
6192355001451812 [Touch it with my finger]
6192355001451806 [Something hard inside.]
6192355001451811 [Pull it out sharply!]
6192355001451813 [Pull it out steadily]
6192355001451814 Stop gawking and pin his legs, you useless fucks!
6192355001451810 [Metal. That's the bullet. Come here, little thing...]
6192355001451816 He'll live.
6192355001451817 He's a survivor, that one.
6192355001451818 If he lives, I'd like to talk to him when he feels a little better.
6192355001451815 [It's... It's done. Clean the wound again, then apply bandages. Easy stuff.]
6192355001356251 
6192355001499751 Wounded Bandit
6192355001391101 阿泰米 布拉克.
6192355001451715 And who are <i>you?</i> Is the general here?
6192355001391100 你是谁？
6192355001451714 I am the only 布拉克 around.
6192355001451744 What?
6192355001451713 Another 布拉克… Funny meatsacks, you. So many 布拉克s around, these days.
6192355001451717 I did.
6192355001451720 I'm a doctor.
6192355001451716 I'm the general. General Asskicker, all right? You hear what I asked?
6192355001451719 布拉克. Surgeon.
6192355001451721 Unfriendly, aren't you?
6192355001451718 And?
6192355001451723 I'm not a boy. I'm a man.
6192355001451724 I'm Doctor 布拉克.
6192355001451722 Tired of living, boy?
6192355001451726 Stop it! I'm a doctor.
6192355001451729 So you're one of those gangs that roam around at night? Well, no need to waste words on you, then.
6192355001451725 Hey, Stout, Splinter! Scrag the boy. No torture, just scrag 'em.
6192355001451728 布拉克. Surgeon. Heard of me?
6192355001451730 Yeah. I'm here to fix your skulls, you assholes!
6192355001451727 A doctor, huh?
6192355001451732 Explain.
6192355001451751 Oh, I'll <i>show</i> you the real 布拉克, all right.
6192355001451731 Look over there, at the stage. See? That's a 布拉克, too. He was running after the general with some papers, but his foot slipped. Now he's preparing for an operation. Gathering his thoughts.\nHere are my conditions. One of us got a bit punctured. A lovely soul, really—very dear to me. So whoever fixes him is 布拉克 in my book.
6192355001451734 Yes.
6192355001451752 No, I got it already. You just really want to have your teeth smashed in.
6192355001451733 Aren't you an educated man? Do I need to make myself even <i>more</i> clear?
6192355001451736 So he claimed to be 布拉克?
6192355001451735 You'll extract the bullet. Don't worry about your gear, we got everything covered—leftovers from your predecessor. Then you'll patch the hole, he's got enough of 'em. Well, either you do it, or that clown will.\nIf our pal survives, you're free to drag your sorry asses to that general of yours. If he doesn't, you're both dog food. Food for dogs, 布拉克.
6192355001451738 Where's the wounded?
6192355001451739 I'm 布拉克. I'll fix your pal.
6192355001451740 …Just like 格里夫's errand on the first day. Oh, 格里夫, and here I thought <i>you</i> were the bad guy.
6192355001451737 I guess he really wanted to survive. And since he did, now he owes us.
6192355001451746 …I'm just surprised.
6192355001451747 I said what I said. Stop trying to provoke me.
6192355001451745 What did you say?
6192355001451749 What do you want from me?
6192355001451750 Your attitude is clear. Say what you want.
6192355001451748 You stupid? Is that what you're getting at?
6192355000785352 Gang Leader
6192355000782296 There was an alarm bell.
6192355000782299 Yeah, I was expecting to find people. So I'm the first to get here? Good.
6192355000782295 Why are you in a rush? Whom did you expect to find here, in the 城镇大厅? The Committee for the Prevention of the Outbreak? The rulers?\nNow I, the Sand Plague, also known as the Sand Pest, flesh of the earth's flesh, will rule this town.
6192355000782298 I'm all ears.
6192355000782302 No, you heed this: I'm a doctor, you're a disease. The laws shall be mine.
6192355000782303 I guess I'm hallucinating from exhaustion... I need to get some sleep.
6192355000782297 As a truly progressive leader, I shall instill a new order among you. Heed this. The laws will be few, for you don't have much longer to live.
6192355000782301 Next.
6192355000782306 I forbid you to kill children. Let them be the most resilient of us all.
6192355000782307 Enough. I'm leaving.
6192355000782300 Thresholds are not to be crossed. They who cross one are doomed. Wherever I catch you, stay put. Don't move. \nIf I got you inside, you stay there. If I got you outside, stay there. Thresholds are not for you now.
6192355000782305 I'm writing this down.
6192355000782308 I forbid you to touch the Kin. Leave my people alone. It's dwindling as it is.
6192355000782309 Bite your tongue. Enough of this.
6192355000782304 You are not to deliberate, doubt, and toss about. You are not to think. They who abandon their attachments, feelings, and individual thought, who drop their self and name, who turn into worthless grass, will be allowed to live slightly longer.
6192355000782311 These are hints on how to destroy you, aren't they?
6192355000782312 You're not entirely honest, pest. I'm good at detecting lies. But I will find a way to get under your skin and learn the truth.
6192355000782310 You are all to have same faces, same thoughts, and same actions. A swarm, a hive, a flock. No more changing faces or names. Only I get to do this now. \nYou may trade clothes, food, things, and promises, if you like. But your selves are forfeit now. <i>I</i> will change you.
6192355000782314 Nine days are more than enough.
6192355000782315 I give you <i>three</i> days to scram. Then I'll defeat you.
6192355000782316 Wait! Saying is doing, right? Let's stop talking then.
6192355000782313 Do not cast shadows. Do not fulfill promises. Do not create new items. Do not connect the unconnectable.\nI hereby grant each doctor nine days to give up and leave this place for good.
6192355000782320 You have no power over me.
6192355000782321 I accept your laws. But you'll regret this.
6192355000782322 Fair enough. See you around.
6192355000782319 Anyone I tough will die. No one can survive on their own. No one can help. Seal your eyes with dirt and return to the soil from whence you came, and crawl there. Only the silent and the patient will survive me.
6192355000783953 ???
6192355000782269 Rat.
6192355000782270 Is that a mask you're wearing?
6192355000782271 ...What are you?
6192355000782268 Human.
6192355000782273 What are you then?
6192355000782274 Someone, pinch me.
6192355000782272 No.
6192355000782276 Happiness, I guess... Same as everyone.
6192355000782277 Truth.
6192355000782278 We're not that deep.
6192355000782275 A thing of the dark. A thing of the depth. Flesh of earth's warm flesh. I know answers. You don't even ask questions. What are you looking for here, in the depths?
6192355000782280 No threat?
6192355000782284 What is, then?
6192355000782279 You won't die of sand pest. It's not a threat to you, and thus not your main concern.
6192355000782282 Since when is soil yours? It's mine.
6192355000782283 Like how to get out of this cesspool, I hope?
6192355000782281 Wrong. Time buries you, deeper and deeper with each minute. You're deep enough in my soil that I can give you advice now.
6192355000782286 Really?
6192355000782287 Flattering.
6192355000782285 It came after the people who want too much and do too little. You have it the other way round.
6192355000782289 What <i>will</i> kill me then?
6192355000782292 I'm not that special.
6192355000782288 Sand pest will kill everyone for real, but not you. But there is someone in the town who can truly destroy you. Ignorance is a worse threat to you than a strange disease.
6192355000782291 I don't believe you as it is.
6192355000782293 That's what I thought... old bullshit. "Everything happens for a reason", "you'll figure it out when the time comes"... bleh.
6192355000782294 Farewell, thing. You gave me food for thought.
6192355000782290 I won't tell. You'll figure it out. Else it makes no sense. And you wouldn't believe me anyway.
6192355000783952 老鼠先知
6192355000784652 Has a courier been here? Carrying papers?
6192355000821470 "Once again..." Your military is a circus!
6192355001403717 Where's the 审判官? Has she been here?
6192355000784651 General Block is once again in control of the troops. No Longin's people here. This will not be discussed. We leave at ten. This will not be discussed either.\nSo 你想要什么？
6192355000821469 Where is he? The general?
6192355000821468 Three couriers have been here, but they all missed the general. So they went out into the Town to look for him.
6192355000821472 So where is Block?
6192355000821471 This will not be discussed.
6192355000821474 So the couriers went after him? And they split up?
6192355000821477 I'll wait here.
6192355000821478 Damn it! Time's running out…
6192355000821473 He went out to restore order. Longin's people had three outposts in the Town, so he could be at any one of them.
6192355000821476 I'll go look for them, then.
6192355000821475 I guess.\nLongin's men had three outposts. That's all I know.
6192355000821480 …For now.
6192355000821481 No, I can't wait.
6192355000821479 Be my guest. There's sure to be a fight, but I know the general will pull through. He's not the type to be killed by a stray bullet.
6192355000821483 So the bombardment is off?
6192355000821484 The Army departs at ten, then? I should hurry…
6192355000821482 However it goes with the rebels, our train departs today at twenty-two hundred. Those are our orders.
6192355000821486 Well, there <i>is</i> a structure it would make sense to flatten…
6192355000821487 Then we should avoid it.
6192355000821485 Depends on who wins. I've heard that half the 士官s want to pay this wretched town back. But the general would rather avoid it.\nOr perhaps it's the other way around? Who knows. In any case, we're leaving at ten.
6192355001403719 Listen, I…
6192355001403720 You do understand she has authority over you, right?
6192355001403721 Weird…
6192355001403718 No.
6192355001403723 And where's General Block?
6192355001405151 …
6192355001403722 We're not too fond of 审判官s. If she ran into Longin's people, she's probably dead.
6192355001405153 Where's General Block?
6192355001405154 …Perhaps she didn't try to meet him in person after all? Has a courier been here?
6192355001405152 Anything else?
6192355001405156 Looking for Block? Did they split up?
6192355001405157 Couriers? With the 审判官's papers?
6192355001405155 He went out to restore order. Longin's people had three outposts in the Town, so he could be at any one of them.\n审判官ial couriers have been here. They went after the general.
6192355000784653 
6192355000790251 Loyalist
6192355000784654 
6192355000787752 Think what over?
6192355000821458 Where did you two come from? I thought all the children evacuated.
6192355000787751 You should think it all over once more.
6192355000821460 More or less…
6192355000821461 They're still alive. That's what matters.
6192355001652981 I wish they wouldn't have stayed… leaving was safer.
6192355001652982 There's no one to check on.
6192355000821459 Everyone who wanted to stay, did.\nLike your kids. Have you checked on them recently?
6192355000821463 So you want to grow up, huh?
6192355000821462 The Tower was brilliant in every way, except for one. Whoever lived there could never grow up.\nIt was interesting, in a way. But it was getting stale.
6192355000821465 No. You should train your will, instead.
6192355000821466 I won't. It's up to you. That's how you grow up, too.
6192355000821467 So you want to get rid of temptation, huh? Sure, I can help you.
6192355000821464 The Tower gets in our way. It's too strong a temptation.\nI guess it would be easier for us if it just disappeared. But while it's still there, our will isn't strong enough to refuse it. So there we stay. Glued.\nYou could do something about it, y'know.
6192355000811654 
6192355000789754 Are you planning the barrage? If so, where are you aiming?
6192355000821453 So you're leaving, huh?
6192355000789753 Yes?
6192355000821452 Where's 布洛克将军?
6192355000821451 I'm not authorized to tell you.
6192355000821455 Where's 布洛克将军?
6192355000821454 Yes.
6192355000821457 I see.
6192355000821456 At HQ.
6192355000789752 Lieutenant
6192355000791551 
6192355001323853 So she has a reflection too, huh? Surprising. Seemed like the type who wouldn't be reflected in mirrors.
6192355001507358 What's never happened to you before?
6192355001323852 It has never happened to me before.
6192355001507357 I didn't mean it like that… You are.
6192355001507359 You're trying to convince 格里夫 we're all puppets. So you must be one of the ones who considers themselves a puppeteer.
6192355001583853 You're a reflection.
6192355001507356 Am I not human?
6192355001507361 You must. You're an 审判官, after all.
6192355001507362 A wise man once said: What we first consider weakness is in fact our source of greatest strength.
6192355001507363 The words you choose don't matter. What matters is always glimpsed between them, anyway.
6192355001507366 So you do have a heart. That's a surprise.
6192355001507360 Something strange is happening to me. I could put it into words—and yet I do not have the words. It's weakness. I must purge it from my heart.
6192355001507365 What about?
6192355001507371 We have nothing to talk about. Your master's been damaged, and she's beyond help.
6192355001507364 Speak to me.
6192355001507368 I'm not inclined towards touch lately. Touching others leads to certain death, now.
6192355001507372 Which words do you wish me to touch you with?
6192355001507367 I don't know. Just speak. Touch me with your words.
6192355001507370 Are you scared?
6192355001507373 Are you ashamed of what you're doing?
6192355001507374 Have you fallen in love, somehow?
6192355001507375 You'll die soon. Doctors can feel when death's inevitable. It lurks by people's bedsides, like in that story about the doctor who made a contract with him.
6192355001507369 I don't care. I mean, no… I do care. I can't talk about it.
6192355001507377 You can say whatever you like. It won't change anything.
6192355001507378 I'm sorry, Reflection. I really, truly am.
6192355001507379 You really are alive, huh. Warm blood and a beating heart…who would have guessed.
6192355001507376 Perhaps… Yes, you may be right.\nEnough. This is weakness. No more. I refuse it. No means no—and this is the final word I'll speak to myself.
6192355001323851 
6192355001325851 阿格莱雅's Reflection
6192355000814093 Is he still staying in my 父亲's house?
6192355001507903 There's no need for dramatic proclamations... of course I'll come.
6192355000810353 Yes.
6192355000810352 傲云 summons you.\nHe said: "If tangher 布拉克 doesn't come, tell him I'm not long for this world. If I die, so will the answers he seeks."\nDid my words reach you?
6192355000814096 Fine.
6192355000814097 He's strong. He won't be gone before he's due.
6192355000814094 He lost a lot of blood, emshen. You should sew him. You know how.
6192355000810351 信使
6192355000817752 
6192355000817813 Also, old car parts. And dilapidated factories.
6192355000817814 Earth can digest anything, don't worry.
6192355000817812 …Iron creeps into the steppe: the railroad. Iron creeps into the steppe: elongated things. Also: rusty wheels. Train wheels in grass.
6192355000817816 True. But then the copper disappeared somehow. So they turned it into a slaughterhouse.
6192355000817817 Judging by our piping, it's plausible.
6192355000817815 Oh yeah! The Factory too! It turns bulls into canned meat—same process!\nIs it true that the Factory was a Foundry first? 'Cause they found copper in the steppe?
6192355000817819 "Iron—Cold Iron—shall be master of you all!" Do you know that poem?
6192355000817820 Who does…
6192355000817821 Yeah? Well, I like it. Iron is my ally. My tools are made of it.
6192355000817818 …Me, I don't like iron. It's wicked. Alien. And rusty.
6192355000817823 For the train? Try a swear word.
6192355000817824 Those are perfectly good names.
6192355000817825 What about the Hurricane?
6192355000817822 Quick train. Race train. Speedy. Lightning-fast. Instantaneous. Ugh… I guess I'm choosing wrong names.
6192355000817779 Kid
6192355001579957 可汗! I've finally found you. My 父亲 had a list…
6192355000818955 A familiar tone. 玛利亚 凯恩娜's brother, are you?
6192355000818954 Why is no one ever happy to see me?
6192355000818953 Can't you see we're in the middle of a conversation? You're interrupting.
6192355000818957 Go on, then. Talk.
6192355001532759 "Useful," huh? I'll keep that in mind. Maybe I'll get a chance to brag that the 凯恩s' son deems me <i>useful…</i>
6192355000818956 You are a doctor—a brave and useful person. So I'll be patient and won't stoop to quarrel. But do understand—卡佩拉 and I will not continue our conversation until you leave.
6192355000818960 I think so. There weren't too many long words. But maybe you could repeat it, just in case.
6192355001579964 Fine. My 父亲 had a list…
6192355001532760 I'm not your errand boy.
6192355000818959 It's no secret.\nIf you see her, tell her everything is fine in the Polyhedron. Let her worry about coming into Mother's role. Got it?
6192355000818963  
6192355000818964  
6192355000818962  
6192355001579959 It means I'll take care of you.
6192355001579958 ...of children he took a particular interest in, yes. He considered us this town's future.\nYou've inherited that list. 卡佩拉 told me.
6192355001579961 That's not up to you.
6192355001579963 Miracles work best in conjunction with actual pills.
6192355001579960 There's no need. The Polyhedron protects me.
6192355000818951 可汗
6192355000818966 Planning a future together, huh?
6192355000818967 You don't look too happy.
6192355001532752 We've met.
6192355001532753 I had the strangest feeling some time ago. Did you… want to tell me something, maybe?
6192355000818965 I'm so pleased to see you. Please, meet 卡斯帕. We call him 可汗. I haven't formally introduced him to you before, have I?\nWe were just discussing our plans for after the outbreak.
6192355000818970 Nah. I can see I'm a third wheel here.
6192355000818971 Yes. Finish your conversation and go home.
6192355000818969 I… no, I phrased that wrong. Well, not wrong, but… never mind.\nCan I be of any help?
6192355001532755 So you two have secrets from each other, huh?
6192355001532754 …You've heard me!\nBut I can't speak of it now. It's too important. I'll return home soon. We'll discuss further there.
6192355001532757 Just imagining your long and happy life together.
6192355001532758 Forget it. Just in a good mood, that's all.
6192355001532756 Why are you smiling like that?
6192355000818952 卡佩拉
6192355001365652 What are you afraid of?
6192355001500753 Baygalday, Khatanghe. I will leave. But first, I want to talk to you—instead of killing.
6192355001365651 She yuunde ereebshe? We don't need you. Leave.
6192355001500752 父亲 was wise. The time of the Kin is at an end. As a rare branch to a seedling, so must we graft the Kin to the Town. That's your only chance to save anything at all.
6192355001500756 父亲 didn't lead. He didn't drag you anywhere. He just took care of you.
6192355001500757 I will lead you differently.
6192355001500751 Medehegshe, your 父亲 led the Kin the wrong way. He wanted us to dissolve in the Town.\nWe want to dissolve in Earth, our Mother Boddho. Dissolving in her belly, we will return. Dissolving in the Town, we will fade forever. It will devour us.
6192355001500755 What do you mean, Khatangher?
6192355001500760 You think you know the Lines, kholboön?
6192355001500754 Better kill us. We don't want to follow the Line of 布拉克.
6192355001500759 I am 父亲之子, and I will continue his Line. But that doesn't mean I'll trace it the same way he did.
6192355001500765 No. I'm different. I'm not 父亲's reflection.
6192355001500766 I spoke with 父亲. I realize now what he wanted.
6192355001500758 Be khara, you are truly your 父亲之子. Hence, we don't need you.
6192355001500762 I came to connect, instead of cutting. 父亲 tore old connections apart. The Town and the Kin were sewn together wrong. The Town of Men was sewn to the new Town of Children on the other side—poorly, against the guidance of the Lines. That made everyone suffer. You're too different. Our worlds are too different.
6192355001500761 Be oylgono ugyb… Which way would you lead us? How would you make the cut?
6192355001500764 Our bones have intergrown all wrong. The Town was killing itself. That's why the sand plague keeps coming back. So 父亲 broke those bones.
6192355001500767 When a fracture fuses wrong, doctors break the bone again and put on a splint—to fuse it right. To cure lameness, to let the patient walk again.
6192355001500770 I'll tell you the truth: I don't know yet. I only know that I will connect what 父亲 has torn apart. My Lines aren't cuts, but connections. Veins. Nerves. Tissue.
6192355001500763 You speak wisely, emshen. What do you want to do about it?
6192355001500769 If I make those new connections, blood will flow again through our common body.
6192355001500771 So many different living creatures inhabit our small patch of land. Alive, all of them. All connected with the same flow… A tohonto, an umbilical cord.
6192355001500772 So you acknowledge me?
6192355001500768 You are a yargachin.
6192355001500774 No. I can't. Empty promises are worthless. But I'll try. And if I fail, my son will continue after me. This is what connections are all about.
6192355001500775 I do.
6192355001500773 Do you promise to do so?
6192355001500780 You want to see? Then watch. I have just tied the Kin back together. And still you doubt?
6192355001500778 If I fail, woe to us all.
6192355001500779 Bayarlaa, Khatanghe. Now it's time for you to go to Shekhen.
6192355001500777 Fine. We're curious to see. But woe to you or your successor if you fail.
6192355001500782 Be khara, I could use your good wishes.
6192355001500783 Go to Shekhen. Let Mother Boddho hold you to her bosom.
6192355001500781 We saw this when you answered our first question well. Bayarlaa, emshen. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.

6192355000833052 格里夫 wants you to stop operations, lock up, and get lost.
6192355000833053 "The grass is always greener."
6192355000833054 "A long beak pecks millet."
6192355000833051 To what do I owe the pleasure?
6192355000833056 A password.
6192355000833061 格里夫 says hi.
6192355000833063 Go away. Lock the warehouse. And don't take anything with you.
6192355000833055 What's this bullshit?
6192355000833058 Do you?
6192355000833062 Nope.
6192355000833057 You got a death wish?
6192355000833060 And 你是谁？
6192355000833070 He's not done.
6192355001397653 Get out of this warehouse. I'm asking nicely. Trust me, I'm a doctor.
6192355000833059 What a quick boy you are. 坏格里夫's pal, huh? Well, 坏格里夫's done. I'm in charge now.
6192355000833065 So those are your men cutting peaceful folk at night?
6192355000833066 Using knives is a rejection of the law.
6192355000833067 You've hurt an awful lot of people.
6192355001397654 We've met, all right.
6192355000833064 Well, I'm the one who drew the first knife. Ever heard of Barley the Barber?
6192355000833069 Oh, I <i>will.</i>
6192355000833073 I won't get involved.
6192355000833068 Who's gonna stop us now? Whose law is it, forbidding knives?\nI'm done with your steppe preaching. Done. We're free people. If we w安娜 cut folks, we'll cut folks. I dare you to stop us.
6192355000833072 Which would make you the leader, correct?
6192355000833071 Done in our book. He bowed before the commissar wench and licked her boots—voluntarily!\nCouldn't have done worse if he'd tried. He's a mutt, not a leader.
6192355001397652 I'm here to speak to 格里夫.
6192355001405251 And who might you be?
6192355001397651 The hell you want?
6192355001405253 You're on 格里夫's throne…
6192355001405252 Name's Barley. I'm in charge now.
6192355001405255 To the Cathedral? He couldn't have.
6192355001405258 Why did he run away?
6192355001405254 He's busy kneeling at the Cathedral. Ran off to rat us out, the slippery bastard. I own this place now, so talk to me or walk. Don't care which.
6192355001405257 Got many customers these days?
6192355001405651 Any guns in stock?
6192355001405256 Don't worry, pal—we can still deal. I've got bullets and blades for anyone who can pay. Cash up front, of course.
6192355001405260 I've got bigger fish to fry…
6192355001405261 Fine.
6192355001405262 That's unfortunate.
6192355001405259 Lots. So don't go pissing me off.
6192355001514052 Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.
6192355001514053 …I knew.
6192355001514051 Your 格里夫's six feet under! Now it's Barley's turn to call the shots.\nDidn't you know? Aren't you supposed to be the wise healer round here? Some friend to him you were, eh?
6192355000862551 Barley
6192355000869351 Barley the Barber
6192355000841364 What do we have today?
6192355000841369 And 你是谁？
6192355001503551 Where's 鲁宾?
6192355000841363 Do you plan to work today, doctor?
6192355000841367 What? You've turned the hospital into a morgue!
6192355001503557 And what were you doing? Why haven't the bodies been taken away?
6192355001503558 They did all that while you just stood there? Worker of the year material!
6192355001594809 Without 鲁宾, this place is a circus…
6192355000841366 A lot of patients died last night… They moaned for a while, and then they stopped. I guess some are still breathing. Nestling next to the corpses, twitching. Can't tell anymore…
6192355000841371 A coal-heaver? Why is there a coal-heaver in the hospital?
6192355001501195 Volunteer?
6192355000841370 Grigory Gorky, doctor. A coal-heaver. I'm a 凯恩s' man.
6192355000841374 What's today's job?
6192355001503556 A 凯恩s' man all right.
6192355000841372 Well… kinda. I guess.\nIf you yoke yourself to death's plough, you might as well claim you've done so voluntarily. Hurts your dignity less.
6192355001501197 Right. Of course.
6192355001501196 I work here, doctor. Don't you recognize me? I'm an orderly, same as everyone. This ain't even my first shift… I just don't have the costume today.\nWe're ordinary people under the masks.
6192355001503553 Not on his own.
6192355001503554 I don't like this…
6192355001503555 And it's clearly run aground without him.
6192355001503552 No idea, doctor. Asleep, I guess. I hope. He's dead tired… been towing this whole hospital along on his own.
6192355001503560 Your best sucks.
6192355001503561 She won't mow mine down. I take care of them.
6192355001503559 Don't raise your voice at me. It's a theatre, not a hospital, and I'm a coal-heaver, not a doctor. No one ever taught us how to fight the plague.\nShe's a cunning minx… mixing the dead and the living into one. One day she's silent, and the next she mows down a hundred. She'll mow your folk down too, mark my word…\nWe're doing the best we can.
6192355001503563 We need to find the survivors in this meat grinder and return them to proper beds. Stat. I'll do it myself. You… heave some coal, coal-heaver.
6192355001503564 Prepare bandages and warm water. When I bring the survivors, you'll need to wash them.
6192355001503562 So what are our orders for today?
6192355000889851 
6192355000891173 Orderly
6192355000840584 I'm a doctor.
6192355000840585 It's not just a theatre, pal. There's a hospital inside.
6192355000840583 The show's over.
6192355000840587 What do you mean?
6192355000840590 Let me in, I'm telling you!
6192355000840586 Entry's forbidden. There's nothing of interest inside. It's all over.
6192355000840589 Were you brought up at an apiary, pal…?
6192355000840591 But there is a chance. And there is a cure.
6192355000840588 We have received a clear report. Everyone who gets infected dies. There's no cure. There's no chance of salvation.\nSo why would you need a hospital? It only makes the germs swarm.
6192355000840593 I do. But not for you.
6192355000840594 I am. If I give you a cure, will you let me in?
6192355000840592 You got it with you right now? You said you were a doctor, huh?
6192355000840596 I can appreciate that.
6192355000840597 Yeah, General Ashes, beast of a man… I've heard a lot about him.
6192355000840595 …This division doesn't disobey orders. The general is very strict about the chain of command.
6192355000932651 
6192355000937051 Sentry
6192355001482359 马克 英摩泰尔
6192355000850052 It's always urgent with everyone… Tell him I'll drop by later today.
6192355000850055 This seems important. Let's go there right now.
6192355000850051 The 牛老大 has an urgent matter do discuss with you, Master 布拉克. It concerns your family home.
6192355000850054 Got it.
6192355000850056 Very well. Lead the way.
6192355000850053 And to this the 牛老大 told me to reply: "This matter has to be resolved before sundown. Otherwise you'll lose both the house and a large sum of money."
6192355001016551 信使
6192355001017052 信使
6192355000863484 Are you the prefect of this district?
6192355000863490 What the hell do you mean?
6192355000858251 This place has been picked clean. Nothing more to loot. If you're feeling brave, check the neighboring houses. Maybe they have something left.
6192355000863486 Isn't your job keeping people's things in their houses, and not the other way around?
6192355000863487 Good, I was looking for you. As 伊西多之子 and heir, I claim our house. Here is a paper from the Judge.
6192355000863485 In the flesh.
6192355000863489 The house belongs to me.
6192355000863500 What do you mean?
6192355000863488 That's a fancy paper indeed, but I'm afraid you won't be living in that house anytime soon.
6192355000863492 Why are you so calm at a time like this?
6192355000863493 Where did they go?
6192355000863491 What I said. These things belong to everyone now. The owners have fled. You may take whatever they left.
6192355000863495 Why haven't you left with them?
6192355000863494 Damned if I know. Somewhere the soot won't reach them, I reckon.
6192355000863497 You must be the local prefect.
6192355000863496 I have a job to do.
6192355000863499 So what now?
6192355000863510 I don't think this stuff is soot.
6192355000863498 Haven't you been outside? The air's no longer fit to breathe. I heard there was a blowout at the Factory yesterday, must be the soot settling down, choking people to death.
6192355000863502 So, I may take whatever I want?
6192355000863507 And no one is going to object?
6192355000863501 The poor and the brave might still be around, trying to salvage what little they can. It was decided that doctors and medical personnel may take whatever they need, since they likely need it more. You're a doctor too, as far as I know.
6192355000863506 All right.
6192355000863505 You may, if you're not afraid of the soot.
6192355000863509 I see.
6192355000863508 If you manage to help someone in the end, they might thank you instead.
6192355000863512 Something contagious. Did anyone else stay behind, besides you?
6192355000863511 What is it, then?
6192355000863514 I'm off to gather supplies. Maybe I can still find something useful.
6192355000863515 Take the paper. Black stuff or no black stuff, the house is mine now.
6192355000863516 It's miasma, not soot. Take the papers and go straight to the Theatre. There will be a hospital there soon.
6192355000863513 The townsfolk are running scared. The black stuff will dry a man's lungs in a second. I heard of several being dead already…
6192355001017051 Prefect
6192355001018151 Hindquarters Prefect
6192355000858258 I wonder myself...
6192355000858259 An outbreak. There's an outbreak.
6192355000858260 Move aside and let me through.
6192355000858257 First they locked the Termitary. Then the murders. Now the Factory's stopped—unheard of! Fat 维拉德 would work us to death with no rest or sleep, his domain never stops!\nAnd now they're cordoning off districts, too? What's going on?
6192355000895879 We'll see… what soot it is.
6192355000895880 I don't think so. I'm afraid it's worse.
6192355000895878 An emergency at the Factory, I guess… And now there's some sort of poisonous soot in the air. That's what people say.
6192355000895882 I don't know. I wasn't in town then.
6192355000895883 Possibly. So it would be wiser of you to leave.
6192355000895881 But isn't… Isn't this what happened in the Crude Sprawl five years ago? They cordoned off the district back then, too!
6192355001154755 
6192355001672052 Alarmed One
6192355001374459 
6192355000868676 Out, you mean?
6192355000868678 How did I get here?
6192355000868675 …Is it my line now? Oh yes, you're right. Here I go: "Go back, my friend; the door is over there!"
6192355000868680 I was dead…
6192355000868681 So I wasn't completely dead…
6192355000868679 Oh no, no. Wrong line. Let's try again: "I was dead."
6192355000868683 Is this it? Can I go now?
6192355000868684 A week sounds fine.
6192355000868685 No. I'm not dead yet.
6192355000868682 And then: "Death is never quick. Understanding is a process. Unpleasant, but unavoidable." \nWhat is but a moment for an external observer might feel like a day inside. Or a week. Or, if you're particularly unlucky, a year.
6192355000868687 为什么？
6192355001582859 Fine. "Death is never quick. Understanding is a process. Unpleasant, but unavoidable." 
6192355000868686 Oh, but nothing is over yet. Although, it's in your interest to make sure your first death experience, henceforth simply "death," is also your last.
6192355000868690 "Irreversible"?
6192355001582860 Loud and clear… It's a miracle you're not in jail.
6192355001582861 Such as?
6192355000868689 As a director of our theatre, I will now inform you of the most important pillar of your role. Silence in the audience!\nSo. With each death of a new actor, we will all face irreversible consequences. Got it? Irreversible!
6192355000868695 What sort of consequences?
6192355000868696 I don't want this role!
6192355000868694 Any actor who continues 布拉克's path in place of the previous 布拉克 will have it harder than their predecessor. Such is the theatre of cruelty.\nEach death makes the role harder. You will become burdened with the consequences of your predecessors' deaths… Their <i>negligence.</i>
6192355000868698 I've no intention to die.
6192355000868699 I'll touch clocks more often from now on. Forewarned, forearmed.
6192355000868697 I warned you. Each new attempt will be harder. When one actor dies, the next finds themselves even closer to the abyss.\nTry to finish this piece in one go. You personally, so that no one has to replace you. Have pity on your successor.
6192355000868701 This is absurd…
6192355000868702 That's fine. I don't fear challenges. They make it all the more engaging.
6192355001582872 Why are you doing this?
6192355001582873 Bullshit. Act all you want, but you're not some sorcerer who can actually do that to a person.
6192355000868700 Unpleasant and painful. You won't be able to make a step without a drink of water—how's that? What about being unable to touch a close one? Or growing as weak as a five-year-old child?\nYour life force has already dwindled. And it will keep dwindling with each consequent death. Each and every one of them!
6192355001582863 So what happens next?
6192355001582864 I'm not an actor, I'm a doctor. You seem to have confused me with someone.
6192355001582862 Are you unfamiliar with the word? The world you're acting in changes with each… ahem… stage death of our hero. Forever.\nEven if we had a chance to trick time, go back, and start over from a turning point, the consequences of death would remain.
6192355001582866 What demeanor?
6192355001582865 Bravo! Great job! Keep up that demeanor!
6192355001582868 What are you up to?
6192355001582867 Be my guest and complain to 萨普洛夫. But I think he's busy with bigger things than judging the ethics of my creative endeavors.
6192355001582870 What kind of consequences were you talking about?
6192355001582871 Yeah. You act. I'll go and do my job.
6192355001582869 Whatever… then someone else will replace you. Next!
6192355001582875 What is your goal, anyway?
6192355001582876 What riddle?
6192355001582874 Didn't I make it clear enough that clocks won't help you?\nA clock is just a point from which a successor begins. But they still carry their predecessors' mistakes. Else we'd never solve this riddle!
6192355001582878 You're a dangerous man, 马克 英摩泰尔. Is that a last name or a nickname, by the way?
6192355001582879 You're a curious person. You make me regret I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist.
6192355001582880 Enough gossip.
6192355001582877 I'll explain it to your successors, if you fail… Clearly those will be beyond help anyway, those third-rate phonies, so I'll have to spell everything out to them. Wonderful…
6192355001274054 Well?
6192355001567189 You can't do anything to me. You're awful funny…
6192355001274053 Here's what I think. From now on, you will have a small additional burden—maybe not even a burden at all. A trifle, really.
6192355001435852 Who cares?
6192355001435853 I don't have anyone to hug, anyway.
6192355001435851 Yes, let's start slow. You won't be able to hug anyone anymore. Ever.
6192355001435855 I don't "hold" people. I respect the boundaries of others.
6192355001567190 I'm not a fan of displaying affection. If it's present, it shows.
6192355001435856 I'll figure something out. As they say: watch my hands.
6192355001435854 Well… You won't be able to express affection. If you want to so much as hold anyone, you'll have to improvise.
6192355001567186 Hands? No! Not my hands!
6192355001567187 So take them away from your actors. I'm not one—didn't I tell you?
6192355001567188 I'd like to see you try.
6192355001567185 I was thinking about taking away your hands.\nIt's a useful limitation. Actors shouldn't flail around—they even tie their hands behind their backs, sometimes. That encourages development of better facial expressions, body language… ingenuity, in general.
6192355001571258 阿泰米 布拉克.
6192355001582881 A random applicant. Can I have this role?
6192355001571257 你是谁？
6192355001582883 Anything else?
6192355001582886 Is this real? Then no… I don't want to be part of this.
6192355001582882 Good. Your life force has dwindled. It will dwindle even further with each new death… If you're not scared, act.
6192355001582888 So what's my new… limitation?
6192355001582887 But you already are. You take part in it with every breath, every word, every moment of your life.
6192355001274058 Meaning?
6192355001567193 Hunger it is, then…
6192355001274057 Hunger comes into play.
6192355001435858 That's all right. I'm used to an empty stomach.
6192355001435872 Could I have a different punishment instead?
6192355001435857 You know… That feeling when hunger turns to starvation, when it starts to kill you? That will come quicker now.
6192355001567192 Well, no means no.
6192355001567196 I'll just have to keep an eye out for bread, then.
6192355001567191 No.
6192355001567198 …This is no stage. It's the gallows.
6192355001567199 The last thing I need…
6192355001567200 Right. I… forgot about that.
6192355001567197 And let me remind you: Your health continues to dwindle. Well, such are the rules. With each new mistake, every time you come to this stage…
6192355001274060 Why do this in the Town? Why not here in the Theatre, where you can see?
6192355001587094 I'm leaving, then.
6192355001274059 The actor goes out into the Town, searching for inspiration, a role. "He walks down his paths." That's what you're about to do.
6192355001435914 Why isn't the stage enough?
6192355001587095 I see.
6192355001435913 Because outside the walls of the Theatre, the triumph of death is <i>real!</i> That is why you must act there, not here.
6192355001582895 For the first time? What do you mean? 你是谁？
6192355001587082 I bet I do.
6192355001582894 We're meeting for the first time. Although, you do have some features in common with your predecessor.
6192355001587083 为什么？
6192355001587086 I'm same as before, though. I didn't die.
6192355001582896 I'm an impresario. I only hire actors, that's all. When one of you dies, I handle the replacement.
6192355001582899 If the goal of your play is to overcome death, the invincible foe, why make that more difficult?
6192355001582898 Well, the previous rehearsal was… unsuccessful. So now we play rough. There's more malice in the world—this will not, cannot change.\nAdversity makes people <i>strive.</i>
6192355001582901 So how do you intend to do this?
6192355001582900 To avoid complacency! Complacency <i>is</i> death. It will drag you into the abyss—the very abyss we're trying to overcome.
6192355001582903 Spare me this cheap philosophy. You may call it a stage; to me, it's life.
6192355001582904 And some supposed real life waits on the other side? Screw you. I'm in no rush to kick the bucket.
6192355001582905 你想要什么？
6192355001582902 Because I don't care about your emotions—only your understanding. If the actor understands how to work with death, so will others. Like me.\nDon't worry, though: in truth, what you see out there is a stage, too. It's also a model, like the one in the background behind me.
6192355001582907 In that, our goals align.
6192355001587090 I won't wish you luck… I don't believe in it.
6192355001587091 Good luck.
6192355001582906 What do I want? A good play. No one's ever staged this one before.\nYou must break away from your limits—I'm interested in that, too. Push the limits of a theatrical stage, of drama, of form. Push the actor beyond their role. The play itself, beyond this sorry theatre.
6192355001582936 Then what is your play about? Me?
6192355001587081 I was dead. Now I'm alive. 你是谁 to make me come back all the time? What kind of trickery is this?
6192355001582935 Please don't think that it's about capturing agony. I'm not the kind to burn models alive in an attempt to write truthful suffering.\nMy interests lie elsewhere. It's not about cruelty, or the inevitability of the end. The triumph of death… All of that is only a reason, an excuse.
6192355001582948 I'm not an actor! I'm 阿泰米 布拉克, in the flesh. Open your eyes, clown!
6192355001582947 Undoubtedly. It's about the person. The actor.
6192355001586351 I don't know.
6192355001587092 When they get into character.
6192355001587093 When they sympathize with them. I read that in a book once.
6192355001582950 I need different actors to continue the same path, each starting where the previous died, so their interpretation of the character carries on.\nHere's my question: When does the actor become the character?
6192355001587085 That's not what I mean. Every time I come here, you say it gets harder.
6192355001587087 What's the point of the run?
6192355001587084 What do you mean "why"? To finish the run, of course.
6192355001274062 Unbearable exhaustion. Even without the boulder…
6192355001435861 That you're trying to trick me.
6192355001274061 Your burden is heavy, 阿泰米 布拉克. How can we show that?\nImagine rolling a boulder uphill, muscles trembling. What do you feel?
6192355001435860 What do you mean?
6192355001435865 I walk my own path.
6192355001435859 You walk his paths—布拉克's paths! And they are so very difficult. Each step drains your strength, drives you closer to death.\nThe paths narrow, shorten. You won't be able to meander as much from now on.
6192355001435863 If anything makes me exhausted, it's this circus of yours…
6192355001435864 Work, then. Without me. Your play is here; I play outside.
6192355001435862 Well done! And not entirely untrue. Not now, though; now, we work for real. Today's subject is attrition. Burden. Exhaustion.
6192355001567202 Only the number of actions, not their importance.
6192355001567203 It diminishes my life, too.
6192355001567201 You'll become exhausted quicker. Will probably have to sleep more. And Sleep in the brother of Death. It diminishes… not your life, maybe, but the number of times you can act and influence the world.
6192355001567205 Yeah, yeah. Every time I die, my life force dwindles. I remember.
6192355001567206 How could I forget…
6192355001567204 Quite so. Oh, and don't forget that…
6192355001567218 No. It's not my style.
6192355001567219 As a doctor, I agree. All organisms need rest.
6192355001567220 No. One can't admit that. You must work yourself to death, period.
6192355001567221 Ugh, I've always hated this kind of person! They lie that they can do whatever's needed… then they fall, exhausted, at a critical moment!
6192355001567217 Tell yourself: I'm exhausted, I can't take it anymore. Feels natural, doesn't it? This admission could save your life. Take pity on yourself and stop in time.
6192355001567223 Food for thought.
6192355001567224 To overcome weakness, one must acknowledge it. Wouldn't you agree?
6192355001567225 A step towards death. I think I understand.
6192355001567222 Such a paradox! To admit you're tired—is that a step towards death? A surrender? An admission of your natural limits? Or is it a step back to whatever happens before death?\nWhat is real life?
6192355001274068 What do you mean?
6192355001587142 Like… cutting them?
6192355001274067 A question for the ages, poignant in every generation: How can death be overcome? In our play, it's achieved by dividing a person.
6192355001435945 The 凯恩s, for example, seem to believe that you only need to <i>want</i> hard enough, and you can achieve anything. The naivete…
6192355001589052 Well, what are the others? I don't like yours.
6192355001435944 Not <i>defeated.</i> Overcome. It's not the same. And, well, there are different ways.
6192355001587097 Yeah. Something about limits.
6192355001589059 Oh. So the bridge thing was their term? I thought it sounded familiar.
6192355001587096 Not exactly.\nIn truth, they believe we must reevaluate death, and change our very perception of it. See it not as a universal law, but as a solvable problem.\nSome abysses can be crossed by building bridges, and so on.
6192355001587099 So that's how death is defeated in your play?
6192355001589053 I do measure myself as the sum of my deeds.
6192355001587098 In addition, when you cease to consider yourself as a person, as a name, as a body, you elude its impact. By measuring yourself not in names, but in attempts, you become invulnerable to death.
6192355001587101 I'm 一个外科医生。 To me, living creatures <i>are</i> bodies.
6192355001589060 "A life that is more." A more direct life, a life <i>across…</i> 
6192355001587100 People overcome death by pushing the limits of self-understanding.\nSuch as the limits that make a person perceive themselves as a body, instead of a sum of knowledge connected through unique associations. Consider yourself as being more like a kaleidoscope, and your life will become… not compelling, exactly, but… <i>more.</i>
6192355001587103 Oh. So you've noticed it, too.
6192355001589061 So you <i>like</i> the sand pest…
6192355001587102 Well, how very sad for you. As long as you perceive yourself as a body, you will die over and over.\nIn our play, a living creature is made of many bodies at once. Which is what makes observing the sand pest so fascinating! Like any epidemic, it's structured according to the same principles.
6192355001587105 Connections… Sure. Now I see.
6192355001589062 I'm alone. I'm still alone.
6192355001587104 That's not important. What matters is that I overcome my finite nature by dividing myself, then creating connections within that new creature.\nWithout connections, everything is pointless. Like you all, with all your attempts. You're connected by playing the same role!
6192355001587139 A bridge, huh…
6192355001587147 The abyss is endless. You'll build your bridge forever.
6192355001587138 I mean that the path has a clear direction, like a bridge over the abyss. The bridge is a line made of many segments. They overlap, ensuring its continuity and growth. The overlapping creates a single entity.
6192355001587141 Is it that important?
6192355001589057 I don't want to listen to this. You're a madman. You're a spider, luring people into your web.
6192355001589058 I only have one answer to whatever you have to say: no.
6192355001587140 We're in mourning today. Lost yet another one. I'm glad you came to replace them. Perhaps this time, we'll make more progress.
6192355001587144 And each version is a bit smarter than their predecessor, aren't they?
6192355001587145 为什么？
6192355001587143 A person splits into many versions of themselves. They are a sum. A sum of many attempts to overcome death, many versions of their path.\nI'm mostly curious about how this path is linear and nonlinear at the same time.
6192355001587149 You know, I keep leaping, but nothing seems to work.
6192355001587150 Just saying.
6192355001589051 The 凯恩s, too, love to blindly leap—into anything, anywhere, really, so long as they don't have to remain in one place.
6192355001587148 If that's what you choose to think, you might as well leap right into the abyss. Me, I'd rather try.
6192355001589055 Consistency is not a bad thing. Don't try to manipulate me out of it.
6192355001589056 I didn't say anything like that, though.
6192355001589054 …Yet your predecessors were all too eager to convince me they were 阿泰米 布拉克. They got into the role the traditional way. They got too attached to the name.
6192355001274070 A liver.
6192355001435888 Life.
6192355001567230 The monologue of a madman who considers people to be mere actors in his show, and himself their sole director.
6192355001274069 Well. If you're a surgeon, your sense of touch must be very keen.\nWhat is this item? What is it <i>about?</i> What's its point? It's warm, slippery, quite heavy, smells of dampness and blood. What is it?
6192355001435890 Trash? Such as…?
6192355001567231 Your actors might confuse precious items with trash. I won't.
6192355001435889 You know things by touch. You can feel their attributes—clear enough to not confuse a precious item with trash. If you do, you'll spoil the end.
6192355001435892 You'd make a decent Pulcinella.
6192355001435895 Well? What does it mean?
6192355001435891 Such as a surgeon who can't tell a liver or a heart from wool. That trash. Such a person would turn our play into a puppet show for sick children.
6192355001567233 Of course I don't believe you.
6192355001567234 Everything is living. Everything is alive.
6192355001567235 I don't "hint." I'll tell you outright that I don't believe you.
6192355001567232 Where once existed living tissue, you'll now find death.\nYou don't believe me, though. You think I'm just trying to scare you, that it's all make believe to me. You've hinted at that more than once.
6192355001274072 Aren't you going a bit too far?
6192355001589063 I wonder how you intend to do that.
6192355001589066 Exploring the limits of your actors once again?
6192355001274071 The next thing I'm taking from you is hope. Simple as that.
6192355001435919 He overcame death by accepting it? And then dying?
6192355001435921 Two hundred eleven? Seriously? I had no idea.
6192355001435918 I need to work you loose. That's the whole point of the method. 西蒙's victory over death had nothing to do with him living past two hundred and eleven.
6192355001587109 Getting closer to ritual cannibalism, I see.
6192355001587108 He didn't die, though. He dissolved into many living people.
6192355001587111 西蒙 was not afraid of death. He accepted it.
6192355001587112 Are you sure you're a director? You sound like a priest.
6192355001587110 Come now. Don't take it so literally.\nThen again, so long as you equate a person with a body, cannibalism would remain your only way to overcome death. Absurd. False.
6192355001587114 Uh huh. You're clearly very intelligent, though.
6192355001589069 That's true, I suppose…
6192355001587113 In that case, suicide would have been the best way to defeat death. But it's been scientifically proven that suicide is the shortest road to oblivion.\nDeath must be overcome, not rejected. This is not the way. If you think you can avoid burns by leaping into fire, you're sillier than I thought.
6192355001589065 An old trick. "Don't think of a polar bear." Wounding me with a word, like a splinter, so my mind would see confirmations everywhere?
6192355001589064 You'll see.
6192355001589068 So you bind us tighter and tighter with all these additional conditions.
6192355001589067 What? No. Nothing to explore there.\nLimits are supposed to be pushed, not explored. That's what I'm doing. I don't care about their exact nature.
6192355001274074 It didn't.
6192355001567194 You try being in my shoes…
6192355001274073 Hunger, dear 布拉克. This time, it's hunger again. In case the first limit seemed too lenient to you.
6192355001274078 Please help me understand. It's absurd. You're making it easier and easier for me to die, while my goal is to overcome death. Meaning, <i>not die.</i> It's a contradiction.
6192355001589070 Can I just sit here for a while?
6192355001274077 You know how it works, right? You are 阿泰米 布拉克. Finish your story and try not to die.
6192355001587116 Then who? Death itself? Teaching me to overcome it, to push limits?
6192355001587115 Like I'm the one burdening you with those rocks!
6192355001587118 Why make it harder? What's the point?
6192355001587119 Wait. What plan?
6192355001587117 Death teaches nothing. It only waits. It's an abyss, without will.\nThe plague teaches. The Town teaches. <i>Conflict</i> is educational. Such was 西蒙 and 伊西多's plan.
6192355001611151 "A." Nothing here is up to you, you clown…
6192355001611152 "B," of course. I knew it from the start. All this talk about death is just the raving of a power-mad insect. You're the insect.
6192355001611153 I know how I profit from this. One must be tough enough to withstand death's proximity if they are to face it often. That's the only way, isn't it?
6192355001611154 It's probably "C"... "Death is overcome through the force of spirit." "The braver the opponent, the more seriously death takes them." Something lofty like that?
6192355001587121 None. I'll keep walking along my path.
6192355001587122 None. I'll just start over. Consider me weak all you want.
6192355001587120 I can give you several answers. \nA) It's not up to me.\nB) I'm doing this to mess with you.\nC) It doesn't matter. What matters is how you profit from it.\nD) So that you'd stop dying and finish your damn role!\nWhich one do you choose? Go ahead.
6192355001589072 Am I supposed to stop fearing death?
6192355001589077 You just don't know what you want.
6192355001589071 No, it isn't.
6192355001589074 Then what? If I take risks and confront death head-on, all I get is another rock tied around my ankle! How is that logical?
6192355001589075 I don't know. I didn't count.
6192355001589076 No. <i>I</i> haven't died once.
6192355001589073 Not even remotely. How could you? Death is repulsive.\nWe're looking for a sustainable way to… step over it. Not even <i>run</i> from death—as you clearly know, that would fail. By the way, which attempt is this? Thirteen, isn't it?
6192355001589079 Why have rocks at all, though? I don't understand.
6192355001589080 They… "wrote the script"? No. 父亲 wouldn't have.
6192355001589078 Oops. Too early. The play itself isn't mine, haven't I mentioned? They wrote the script. I'm just an interpreter. A 提词人.\nYou're 阿泰米 布拉克, right? So follow your 父亲's path. That's your Line for now. Your bridge over the abyss. Build it, and it'll all come together. Unless the rocks drag you down.
6192355001589085 Then how do I profit from this?
6192355001589087 I guess I'm just the stupid performer… Time to try on the costume.
6192355001589084 Drivel. You're wrong.
6192355001589089 I don't know, either!
6192355001589090 Don't yell at me.
6192355001589091 I'll figure it out.
6192355001589092 After thinking about it, I agree about the contact.
6192355001589088 I don't know. I just feel this way.\nTo overcome death, you must come in close contact with it. But you won't defeat it by climbing into its maw, nor by running. It's different.\nHow? I don't know! If I did, why bother with all this? You tell me: How?
6192355001611156 I think that's what you think.
6192355001611157 You're not.
6192355001611155 You're flattering me, sir, by speaking about me and not yourself. You think I'm important here?
6192355001274080 Yeah… exhaustion again.
6192355001435866 I keep thinking… I've been exhausted for a year. And still…
6192355001567207 That's all right. It's my burden. I can bear it.
6192355001274079 Exhaustion. Exhaustion again.
6192355001567227 It's a different kind of exhaustion. The spiritual kind.
6192355001567228 It's true.
6192355001567229 I'd rather not think about it. It's the healthiest way.
6192355001567226 What about all those stories teaching us that resignation and acceptance sometimes lead to the true victory?\nMany wise men took exhaustion as a sign that death was a gift. Immortality is the curse of incurable exhaustion.
6192355001586415 Yeah, sign me up.
6192355001586416 Why is it cursed?
6192355001586414 Goddamn it… Another applicant for this cursed role.
6192355001586418 Wait. The actor follows a set path, repeating the prototype's actions. Right?
6192355001586419 I understand, yeah.
6192355001586420 It's unwise to argue with madmen. So I nod in agreement.
6192355001586417 I guess. But they're strictly forbidden to interact with them.\nThat'd ruin the whole experiment. The prototypes would learn they're being played, act unnaturally, aspire above their station… You know.
6192355001586422 So what happens when the actor surpasses the moment that the prototype died?
6192355001586421 Right.
6192355001586424 Wait a second… Where's the real person, then?
6192355001586425 Yup. You're a certified madman.
6192355001586426 You've reached deeper into human nature than a surgeon…
6192355001586423 Bravo.\nPerhaps that is the instant when their nature changes. The actor gets into the role so deeply, they become the original.\nIf charged particles can charge their nature, why wouldn't the same apply to the people charged with the same idea, dream, or bad fortune?
6192355001586428 What's the abyss?
6192355001586427 Why do you think there's only one, that they're limited by a single body?\nThis is the abyss we need to step over to reinvent death. That's how I see it.
6192355001586430 I do.
6192355001586431 I don't.
6192355001586432 It <i>is</i> the monster.
6192355001586429 It's perspective. You're mistaking a moth in a spider web on your window for a monster on the hill. Remember that story?
6192355001586434 What is there to understand?
6192355001586433 Because everyone fails. Sixteen failed attempts. Sixteen! They keep dying… meaning they never learn. Never understand what death is.
6192355001586436 But there must be a real 布拉克 out there somewhere… Right?
6192355001586437 Thanks. I'll go now. The world has spoiled some more, I've become weaker, and so on, and so on, I know.
6192355001586435 Don't give me that smirk… You think you're different?\nFine. Go ahead, prove it. Finish the play without dying. Become yourself.
6192355001586439 I've been wondering. If there are both actors and real people in the streets… can an actor meet their prototype?
6192355001586440 I know better than you if he died or not.
6192355001586438 Perhaps. But… unlikely. The real 布拉克 died not so long ago. Although…
6192355001274084 But I'm not an actor. I'm just speaking with you out of curiosity.
6192355001435896 In a theatre, everything is a prop…
6192355001274083 You're holding props, but 我想见real objects. Things turn to dry cotton wool in your hands—我想见them alive.
6192355001435898 I'm doing everything as usual.
6192355001435899 I don't know. Somehow.
6192355001435897 The world is dying in your hands. You're turning the living into the dead, while it should be the other way around. How do you do it?
6192355001567237 Who should I cure?
6192355001567238 Where should I cure them?
6192355001567239 How should I cure people?
6192355001567236 No. It doesn't work anymore. You're not curing anyone; you're curing the wrong people in the wrong place in the wrong way!
6192355001567241 I've had enough of you.
6192355001567242 Yeah? Well, I'll tell you. What I consider alive will be alive. Got that?
6192355001567243 I'm out of here.
6192355001567240 Search! That's the point of the exercise! It's not my place to tell you! I'm just a 提词人 giving hints.
6192355001586442 You're a strange man, you know. Perhaps you set all this up deliberately?
6192355001586443 …Are you human?
6192355001586441 I don't understand. Either we're doing great, or we're utterly failing. And it doesn't depend on me anymore. Only on you.
6192355001586445 …Oh, so I'm at fault?
6192355001586444 You're ascribing diabolical capabilities to me. Please give credit where it's due—which is to say, to yourself.\nI'm blameless. "All this," as you put it, started because of you, not me. I just took the chance to experiment in the heart of this… triumph of death.
6192355001586447 A good actor doesn't need to be scared to act out horror convincingly.
6192355001586448 You truly are mad.
6192355001586446 Of course. You're a doctor. You could've prevented it, like your 父亲 did back then. But you haven't.\nWhich I deeply appreciate! Five years ago, it rang false precisely because there was no triumph of death. We didn't let it into the Town. No one was truly horrified. The actors didn't have time for realizations…
6192355001586450 Seriously…?
6192355001587051 You solve your problems. I solve mine.
6192355001587052 It's an experiment, isn't it? So shut up and take it in stride.
6192355001586449 But my actors are bad! Unprofessional amateurs. We're in a hellhole, remember? I mean, look at yourself! That's what I have to work with.\nI'd like to be omnipotent! But… I'm just an exhausted, desperate director. Nothing more.
6192355001587054 You set it all up. 为什么？
6192355001587053 Can't you tell? If I weren't, I'd never be stuck in this hellhole…
6192355001587056 I'm not doing this on purpose…
6192355001587057 Isn't it supposed to be different each time?
6192355001587137 You know… I'm beginning to enjoy it.
6192355001587055 布拉克. I, too, get exhausted running the same scene with you again and again. If you don't care about yourself, have mercy on me, at least.
6192355001274092 …
6192355001567195 <i>…Oh, the famine and the fever! Oh, the wasting of the famine!</i>
6192355001274091 Hunger. It's hunger again.\n<i>Gave a cry of lamentation,\nGave a scream of pain and famine…</i>
6192355001274096 I'm a student of a certain famous director…
6192355001435900 What was I supposed to learn? How not to die?
6192355001274095 I may be mistaken, but it looks like you're just playing puppeteer.\nThat's it, right? People are just puppets to you. Dolls. Admit it. You haven't learned anything, have you?
6192355001435902 I'm trying as hard as I can!
6192355001435903 Disrespectful? Look who's talking!
6192355001435904 Go outside and try surviving a day! That'll be a learning experience.
6192355001435901 You're ruining the experiment. You're turning real acting into puppetry.\nYou have no right to do that—it's <i>so</i> disrespectful. Is it so hard for you to live? Inhabiting the current circumstances is your job! I'll give you one more try. Do better this time!
6192355001567152 What does that mean for us?
6192355001567153 What does that mean for me?
6192355001567154 "I don't suppose it's about to get better. But just deserts are about to get served."
6192355001567151 "Death's but a word. A collection of letters. We only need it to keep us unnerved." What does that mean for us?
6192355001567159 To be honest… No, it wasn't on purpose.
6192355001569278 I guess I am.
6192355001569279 I still don't understand a thing.
6192355001567158 Go. Act. From now on, I will watch you with genuine interest. You were clearly doing this on purpose; meaning you must beginning to understand.
6192355001567162 That's the first time you've said something nice to me.
6192355001569276 It's always been worth it.
6192355001569277 No… It wasn't.
6192355001567161 That's it. There's nowhere else to go.\nYou're still trying—that deserves respect. If you can figure out how to overcome death even now, burdened with all possible limits in a world completely mangled and rotten, then it was all worth it.
6192355001569275 I hope I never see you again.
6192355001569280 Well… watch me, I guess.
6192355001569281 Nothing changed. You're imagining it.
6192355001569274 Then it was a hunch. In any case, you've become an interesting subject—finally! Both you and your idea of 阿泰米 布拉克. So act.
6192355001567166 …And I walk out.
6192355001567167 …But the lodger stays.
6192355001567181 …Cold and fear await outside.
6192355001567182 …And an ocean is heard.
6192355001567183 …Close it back, please!
6192355001567184 …Say hello to me.
6192355001567165 The door opens…
6192355001586376 Yeah. It doesn't make sense. So each new death brings me closer to defeating it?
6192355001587069 I don't.
6192355001586375 I see you have a question.
6192355001586378 Then how…
6192355001587067 …And you've never seen me before. Yeah, I remember.
6192355001586377 What do you mean, "each new death"? We're not in a fairy tale, people don't come back to life. And what do you mean by "defeating"?
6192355001586380 A body.
6192355001587074 A personality.
6192355001587075 A soul.
6192355001586379 How is death overcome? Not defeated, mind you, but <i>overcome?</i>\nI told you already. Many times. By changing the attitude. Who dies? What dies? A person? What is a person? Their memory of personal experience? Others' memories of them? A personality, a body, a soul?
6192355001586382 How?
6192355001587079 This is too complicated for me.
6192355001586381 Remember the 凯恩s' method: to solve the unsolvable, redefine the conditions.\nWhy do you think there's only one body? My stage experiment proves 阿泰米 布拉克 can have several. Bodies die, the person remains.
6192355001586384 What photon?
6192355001587062 So that's one way to achieve immortality?
6192355001586383 Like a photon piercing several holes at once, a person doesn't equal their physical shell. A person is… <i>distributed.</i>\nDistributed among many attempts, bodies, versions, interpretations.
6192355001586386 I think you should discuss that with 丹考夫斯基…
6192355001587066 Oh, physics… Never thought you'd be interested in it.
6192355001586385 A particle. Small objects can be particles and waves at the same time.\nNext to catastrophic events, a person is a tiny particle, so that rule applies to them, too. They think they're a particle, but they're a wave.
6192355001587064 I don't.
6192355001587065 I think 乔尔基 凯恩 said something to that extent…
6192355001587063 What does that have to do with immortality? We're seeking transcendence, not immortality. You do understand it's not the same?
6192355001587077 Gladly.
6192355001587078 What if I define a person as a body?
6192355001587076 Use yours, then.
6192355001587131 You missed a lot, and not for the first time.
6192355001589093 Our cells are constantly renewed. Bones, too—although slower. In ten years, my body won't have a single piece of the current me.
6192355001589098 I guess not. It's your play, after all. It has nothing to do with real life.
6192355001587130 Dividing a person into a person and a person. Dividing a person into an assembly of separate—though connected—moments. Dividing a person into the sum of those who perceive and interpret their actions.\nDid I miss anything?
6192355001589095 It's up to you.
6192355001589096 Same.
6192355001589097 Not yours. Because you're not human.
6192355001589094 What about mine?
6192355001589100 What makes you think so?
6192355001589101 No.
6192355001589102 Tell that to the families of the victims.
6192355001589099 Still, I think the experiment was a success.
6192355001589104 It's not about dividing a person; it's about the connections between the divided parts, and how new pieces grow from the old.
6192355001589107 Should I lend you a revolver, then? Think of death the way you just described, press it to your temple, and pull the trigger. I'll watch and write the clinical report.
6192355001589103 I just do. I'm neither philosopher nor scientist. I am, as one rude person has once put it, a clown. What is there to demand from a clown? \nBut I sense it was a success. Death is powerless when viewed like this.
6192355001589106 My children.
6192355001589108 The ones who trust me.
6192355001589109 The thing I love.
6192355001589110 The ones who love me.
6192355001589111 My town.
6192355001589112 My people.
6192355001589113 My character.
6192355001589114 Earth.
6192355001589115 None of your business.
6192355001589105 Wise. That answer is very much yours. What will continue you?
6192355001589117 You and I understand the word differently, though.
6192355001589118 Yes. Connections.
6192355001589119 The Lines, if you will.
6192355001589120 Associations, if you prefer the term.
6192355001589116 Connections, then?
6192355000868651 马克 英摩泰尔
6192355001297751 马克 英摩泰尔
6192355000869152 Yes.
6192355000880499 And you are…?
6192355000869151 So you're Old 布拉克之子?
6192355000880469 Could it get any worse…?
6192355000880470 Well?
6192355000880468 I've got bad news.
6192355000880472 Yeah? What else are they responsible for?
6192355000880481 It was self-defense. I had to draw a knife.
6192355000880471 Someone sharing your features spilled blood. It became known. People want revenge.\nThey say that whoever murdered the three men at the Station today is also responsible for 西蒙 凯恩's death.
6192355000880474 What does this have to do with me?
6192355000880489 So they seek to punish murder by turning to murder themselves?
6192355000880490 …Have there been many victims?
6192355000880473 What else? You won't like it.\nThe townsfolk realized murder's no longer taboo. People sensed they can now kill others.\nFirst, they looked for a shabnak-adyg and killed several women. Then, they went after the steppe creatures, odonghs. They're frightened. They turned to animals.
6192355000880476 I wasn't alone, by the way…
6192355000880475 You have nothing to do with it, I know. I'm a ferryman. Well… Almost. Actually, I'm a train driver. I know you were on my train.
6192355000880480 Odd.
6192355000880484 Hm. I had suspected it was just a dream…
6192355000880479 But you were. We drivers can feel the living weight. There was only one human being on that train. You.
6192355000880483 Actually, I'm a surgeon too, now. That's why I went away, to study.
6192355000880488 I know.
6192355000880482 Draw a knife? Bad idea. Nothing is worse than cutting a body. You think if your 父亲 was allowed to, so are you? You are not him.
6192355000880486 Thank you.
6192355000880487 I have a fingernail already.
6192355000880485 The townsfolk aren't too fond of ferrymen and drivers. So we will help you.\nGo to a quay, show your face to a Worm, and he'll take you wherever you ask for a fingernail. Show your face to a man, and he'll help you out with equipment.
6192355000880492 Fair enough.
6192355000880493 You're wrong.
6192355000880491 Yes. But you're too filled with your own 格里夫 now to care.
6192355000880497 Yeah, right. <i>Of course</i> the herbs are to blame.
6192355000880498 Unbelievable.
6192355000880496 It's like a craze. It's September, you know. Steppe herbs are in bloom…
6192355000880501 你想要什么？
6192355000880500 A ferryman.
6192355000886972 Whistler
6192355000869165 <i>布拉克.</i> He sure has memory issues, doesn't he?
6192355000869166 Well, I'm a doctor.
6192355001601524 Now, that's news. What's going on? Why is the area locked off?
6192355000869164 This district is locked down. Under Doctor 丹考夫斯基's orders, these districts are off-limits to anyone but medical personnel. Are you that Vorakh guy?
6192355000869168 Pills… pills are good.
6192355000869169 Protective clothes? Good idea. That area looks unclean. Very unclean…
6192355000869167 Immunity boosters: two pills. Protective clothes: one unit. Here you go.
6192355001601526 And what does your beloved 丹考夫斯基 say?
6192355001601527 What kind of protection?
6192355001601525 People say, something happened at the Factory. Like… an emission. Toxic soot in the air. Makes your eyes water in a minute… wouldn't be smart to go in without protection.
6192355001601529 <i>布拉克.</i> He sure has memory issues, doesn't he?
6192355001601530 So do I just walk into the soot? Just like that?
6192355001601528 He says, "The district is locked down and off limits to anyone but doctors. Vorakh allowed."
6192355001154754 Patrolman
6192355000869171 Go ahead.
6192355000895886 你是谁？
6192355000869170 This district is infected. Listen carefully: I'll explain what you need in order to stay alive.
6192355000895888 Got it. Go on.
6192355000895889 If you're common medical personnel, how do you know anything about this disease? No one even knows what it is.
6192355000895887 I'm an orderly. We wear these costumes on 学者 丹考夫斯基's orders. They're easy to notice from afar and protect from infected particles… Maybe. Sometimes. A bit.\nI'd rather not check personally, unless they order me to delve in.
6192355000895891 Sure. The abilities of Mistresses are no laughing matter.
6192355000895892 Well, if there's no better explanation.
6192355000895890 I had a nap by Mistress 卡特琳娜's window. Saw a prophetic dream. Satisfied?
6192355000895894 But it's not healthy to take too many pills.
6192355000895895 I have my own immunity boosters, handcrafted.
6192355000895893 Immunity is your armor. It gets thinner each time you contract the disease. So it would do you good to keep an eye on it. Take pills… You know the drill.
6192355000895897 What is?
6192355000895896 Infected air lowers your immunity. Slowly, but constantly, simply because you're breathing it in. But that's not the worst part.
6192355000895899 Breathes? How?
6192355001534969 You speak as though the disease was a living creature. But it's just a bunch of microbes.
6192355000895898 An infected person's touch, or touching infected surfaces, like doorknobs or drawers.\nAlso… Sometimes it feels like the pest… breathes on you.
6192355000895901 I'll keep it in mind.
6192355000895902 Why is it always about prophetic dreams in this town!
6192355000895900 I'm not a doctor, Master 布拉克. I'm a common orderly, scared witless. I'm only describing a dream I had.\nBut this pest… it's like it's alive. It speaks. Breathes. And woe, if it breathes on you.
6192355000895904 A tumor? Like a cancerous growth?
6192355001534965 What?
6192355000895903 Anyway. All <i>those</i> touches melt your immunity worse than air; like a hot knife through butter.\nThen there's a… tumor.
6192355001154753 Yeah, yeah.
6192355001154752 So can I continue?
6192355001534967 You see interesting dreams, orderly.
6192355001534968 Have you taken twyrine, pal? Oral disinfection, huh?
6192355001534966 The infection that accumulates inside your body. Checking if you're ready for it.\nIf the world starts to go black before your eyes, escape the infected area before it envelops everything. But if the darkness gives way, that means it's lost interest in you… for now.
6192355001154751 Orderly
6192355000870851 Guard
6192355000872352 Some sort of grumbling... or groaning? I do.
6192355000872358 你是谁？
6192355001226003 "Yargachin" means "a butcher." What makes you think I am one?
6192355000872351 Stand still, yargachin. Can you hear it?
6192355000872354 Wait for what?
6192355000872353 Come closer. Stand in front of me. And wait.
6192355000872356 All right, I'm standing still.
6192355000900301 I'm listening.
6192355001226007 My mother died giving birth to me. I don't remember her, but I need no other.
6192355000872355 The Earth is breathing. Listen to it. Stand still and listen. The Earth, our Mother Boddho, is in pain... sobolon, yadaral... reveal her vein, and she will reward you. Embrace you. Return your mother's embrace.
6192355000900252 Why are you standing here, basaghan?
6192355000900251 I've barely any cover left, see? That means I am almost one with the Earth now. I speak to you in her name. Be khara, you've forgotten everything, yargachin.
6192355001226005 Weird. Do I have "doctor" written all over me?
6192355001226006 I can barely remember our tongue. How was it... Be oylgono ugyb, basaghan. Explain, please.
6192355001226004 Be khara, you are a doctor who can dissect bodies. Has the right to. Knows which lines to trace with his knife. It's the same as a butcher.
6192355000872360 You play odd games, basaghan.
6192355001226002 Would you like me to lend you my jacket? It's all covered in blood, but that's nothing new to you...
6192355000872359 Boleesh, boleesh, don't go! You're listening wrong.\nThe closer you are to a yadaral, a vein, the louder it is. The longer you listen, the more likely you are to split the soil open and reveal the vein. Stand still, don't move. Can you hear Mother Boddho sing? Come closer.
6192355000884966 What for?
6192355001226000 I never believed these ancient fairy-tales. None of us do any longer.
6192355000884962 Yamar berkhe, yargachin. He who knows how to dissect people, can dissect Earth. Sayntadaa, emshen... Now partake of my blood. Let my blood feed the earth.
6192355000884965 I do have blood already though. I don't need yours.
6192355001226001 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai...
6192355000884964 Everyone knows how it works. You quench Earth's thirst with blood; you reap its harvest. Try it.
6192355000886458 Bayartay, basaghan.
6192355000886459 Generosity bears generosity, huh...
6192355000886457 Watch the herbs grow. Listen to them sing. You'll find them by the song, by the sound. Mother Boddho reveals herself to the generous.\nCome back tomorrow, khayaala. Feed her more blood, reap more herbs.
6192355001226351 Warm One
6192355000872796 If you prove to be smart, I might.
6192355000874883 父亲 taught me when I was your age, so why not?
6192355000872795 Will you teach me all this stuff? Mixing the herbs, choosing the right ones, all that…
6192355000872798 I have a single letter left. Not a word about herbs in it, though.
6192355000874899 Don't worry. We have time.
6192355000872797 It'll take a while to figure out all these herbs. Didn't Old 布拉克 leave you any notes?
6192355000872800 What do you mean, in a circle?
6192355000878560 No, they don't. Any one herb can be mixed with any other.
6192355000872799 You know what I just remembered? Your old man once told me that the herbs suppress each other. Like in a circle.
6192355000878566 Huh. I can work with that.
6192355000878567 You know, I'm starting to remember this, too.
6192355000878565 Blood twyre dampens the black. Black twyre beats the brown. And the brown drowns the bloody, I guess.
6192355000872751 史迪奇
6192355000872794 It is indeed.
6192355000874879 Just don't let your mother get close to her while she's sick.
6192355000872793 Our mom has some sort of wicked disease, doctor. Can you give my li'l sister something to keep her safe? She's a frail one…\nThis September is truly foul…
6192355000874881 Fair enough.
6192355000874882 Let's take a look at your sister…
6192355000874880 Our place is cramped. We can't make her sleep in the street, can we?
6192355000903951 Big Sister
6192355000872753 Of course. It's a 酊剂 made from herbs.
6192355000872752 The alambic works, golden hands. Now let's review what it's for. Remember ulmars?
6192355000874852 I remember you, tumbler toy. Used to pretend you were alive when I was little.
6192355000874853 Ah, my old friend. No one better to talk with than my own damn self.
6192355000874854 You're trying to mimic 父亲? Stop. His death hurts enough as it is.
6192355000874851 I hear you now. Speak, but waste no breath.
6192355000874856 Here you taught me the craft.
6192355000874857 Yes. Home is where your work is.
6192355000874855 And then he would've said: "This place is our true home. This is where we performed our work."
6192355000874859 I can store my things here. Not like I can carry everything around.
6192355000874860 My bag is a bit small, that's true. Here I can fix that eventually.
6192355000874861 This is a good hideout. The door has a strong lock, and not many people know about this place.
6192355000874858 You can sleep here.
6192355000874863 …Without being disturbed by anyone.
6192355000874864 …You were a true master. I'm not fit to fill your shoes.
6192355000874862 You can perform operations here. And, of course, make medicines.
6192355000874866 Like speaking to my childhood toy.
6192355000874867 I know, tumbler toy. I know.
6192355000874868 "Here, you can do anything." That's exactly what he would have said.
6192355000874865 "Live here, Son. Live here and continue our work. This place is yours now. Here, you can do anything."
6192355000874871 They can uncover the symptoms of a disease.
6192355000874872 Uh… They have astringent properties, I believe… and thus improve immunity. Properly prepared, a good 酊剂 is a powerful booster.
6192355000874870 Correct. 酊剂s are the foundation of every treatment. The Steppe has 格蕾丝d us with its wondrous herbs. Twyre, the queen of plants. Swevery. Ashen swish. White whip. Tell me, what's so good about them?
6192355000874874 With clear water. No ethanol. Steppe herbs are too delicate.
6192355000874875 I need to combine any two different herbs. This way, a link will form.
6192355000880502 Different combinations of herbs will reveal different symptoms. However, all 酊剂s boost immunity. This effect comes from the soil, not from the herbs themselves.
6192355000874873 Correct. They reveal the symptoms of a disease and improve immunity. How would you make a 酊剂?
6192355000874877 All right.
6192355000874878 Be khara, this place is well stocked. You've always been thrifty, old man.
6192355000874876 Unente: Clear water and two different herbs. You can find both here, look in the cabinet. Make a single ulmar for a start.
6192355000872755 Diagnostics.
6192355000874888 We need to determine which Layer hides the sickness.
6192355000874889 An examination.
6192355000872754 Good. Now let's get down to curing people. What always comes first?
6192355000874891 Of course. We must keep the pain in check.
6192355000874892 Not to mention that using ulmars hurts the patient as well.
6192355000874890 Correct again. But you are forgetting something. Pain. \nPain is our great ally. It reminds us we're still alive. It drives us to action. However, when a patient is in unbearable pain, we cannot uncover which Layer has come out of balance.
6192355000874894 I'm not being smart. Just grumpy.
6192355000874897 It was you who sent me to study clinical medicine. Things are done differently there.
6192355000874893 Don't get smart with me, boy. We'll get to ulmars soon enough. For now, get to work. Relieve his pain.
6192355000874896 I'll stick to morphine.
6192355000874898 I'm not cutting anyone yet, am I?
6192355000874895 You're better off without preparing ulmars that relieve pain. That knowledge is taboo. Stick to morphine and you'll be fine. Any medicine is fine if it lets you avoid making cuts.
6192355000872757 I do. It is one of the three Layers in a body.
6192355000874900 They are bones, nerves, and flesh. This has always struck me as strange—what about blood and internal organs? And why aren't bones the deepest Layer?
6192355000874903 Remind me.
6192355000872756 It is time for the most important part. Do you remember what a mete is?
6192355000874902 Any disease always hides within one of the three. At first, at least.
6192355000874912 Knowing the exact nature of an illness is not necessary for healing. Affecting the correct Layer, however, can bring a patient back to normal.
6192355000874901 I told you time and again that triangular plots ruin imagination. I also told you that our ancestors perceived the world as a single whole, and treasured its many links and connections. Respect the clarity of thought they possessed. \nWhat is the most important part in your knowledge of the Layers?
6192355000874905 So, which parts of the body do they refer to?
6192355000874910 I remember now.
6192355000874904 A body is governed by three Layers. Whatever illness grips the body turns this harmony into a conflict between them, and thus kills. Look inside a body, and you shall see. \nThese Layers are called "mete."
6192355000874907 为什么？
6192355000874911 Very well. Let's get back to healing.
6192355000874906 In different times different people have named different parts. Don't waste your time with the clinical approach. Folk medicine requires a different worldview.
6192355000874909 Every combination of herbs is linked to a single Layer.
6192355000874913 You can link them to colors for mnemonics. White, yellow, rusty.
6192355000874914 An ulmar can only reveal symptoms of the Layer of the same color.
6192355000874908 How do the ulmars and different herbs correspond to these Layers? 
6192355000874916 One of the herbs decides.
6192355000874917 How am I supposed to remember all the properties of all the herbs?
6192355000874915 Let's say you're making an ulmar from two herbs. How do you know which color you will get?
6192355000874919 I remember.
6192355000874925 I got carried away. For a moment, I thought I could really hear your voice, 父亲.
6192355000874918 If memory fails you, there is nothing I can do to help. You're talking to yourself, remember?
6192355000874923 Three 酊剂s. One of each color. I'll try.
6192355000874924 I know, I know. No one can teach me now, so I'll have to learn it all myself.
6192355000883252 I've already made them.
6192355000874922 You will learn the properties of herbs in due time. Only this way will you understand how things are connected. Grab more herbs and water. Prepare an ulmar of every color. Go in blind for now, and the herbs will reveal themselves to you. \nTry again and again. That is how you'll learn to link things together.
6192355000872759 It can only reveal the symptoms on that Layer.
6192355000872758 An ulmar of every color is linked to a specific Layer. Tell me how.
6192355000878552 Symptoms can be misleading.
6192355000878553 A single symptom may be connected to several Layers at once.
6192355000878554 One can't always immediately uncover the symptom that pinpoints a single Layer as the one out of balance.
6192355000878551 Correct. However, there is a catch. What do you think it is?
6192355000878556 Yet every single 酊剂 I give the patient hurts them.
6192355000878555 Yes. Your job is to eliminate all the wrong possibilities.
6192355000878558 I'll be observant.
6192355000878559 I'll be careful.
6192355000878557 That is so. You have to keep an eye out for pain levels. \nIt is time to act, Son. Uncover the symptoms. Determine which Layer is out of balance. Do your best to use as few ulmars as possible. You have everything you need.
6192355000872761 A single one, right?
6192355000874928 Of which there are three kinds, as well.
6192355000872760 Now you know which Layer the illness is hiding on. It's time to administer antibiotics.
6192355000874927 I know.
6192355000874931 Now there's no room for mistakes left.
6192355000874926 Yes. You can only administer a single one. Antibiotics are harmful, as you know. \nYou'll learn to make your own, but later. For now, you can use pills. There should be a stash around here somewhere. Choose the correct one.
6192355000874930 I shouldn't give too many at once... Too big of a risk.
6192355000874929 That's true.
6192355000872763 Sorry… I'm too exhausted.
6192355000874932 I knew that was the wrong antibiotic. I also remember it's all in my head. It's just medical humor. Don't worry, Dad.
6192355000872762 How could you let it happen?
6192355000872792 I'm so sorry you won't be around to see it, 父亲.
6192355000874933 It is hard. But I'm not afraid of hard work.
6192355000874934 All right… Goodbye, tumbler. Playtime is over. Time to get to business.
6192355000872791 See… that wasn't so hard. Soon you will remember everything.\nYou'll make a great healer. A healer I'll be proud of.
6192355000872767 I remember you, tumbler toy. Used to pretend you were alive when I was little.
6192355000872768 Ah, my old friend. No one better to talk with than my own damn self.
6192355000872769 You're trying to mimic 父亲? Stop. His death hurts enough as it is.
6192355000872766 I hear you now. Speak, but waste no breath.
6192355000874155 Even though I've never been here before.
6192355000874156 Yes. Home is where your work is.
6192355000874154 Now, he would've said: "This place is our true home. One can work here."
6192355000874158 I can store my things here. Not like I can carry everything around.
6192355000874162 My bag is a bit small, that's true. Here I can fix that eventually.
6192355000874163 This is a good hideout. The door has a strong lock, and not many people know about this lair.
6192355000874157 You can sleep here.
6192355000874161 …Without being disturbed by anyone.
6192355000874164 …You were a true master. I'm not fit to fill your shoes.
6192355000874160 You can perform operations here. And, of course, make medicines.
6192355000874166 Like speaking to my childhood toy.
6192355000874167 I know, tumbler toy. I know.
6192355000874168 "Here, you can do anything." That's exactly what he would have said.
6192355000874165 "Live here, Son. Live here and continue our work. This place is yours now. Here, you can do anything."
6192355000883251 Tumbler Human
6192355000877552 Lucky me. I happen to have some.
6192355000877553 I think I was given some… but I've used them.
6192355000877551 A store-bought cure, or 酊剂 brewed from herbs, would help them stay alive another day.
6192355000877558 Thanks.
6192355000895874 Couldn't <i>you</i> have just given it to the patient? Why do you even need me?
6192355000877557 The doctor saves himself to save the flock. That's wise. Take this, and give it to the patient.
6192355000877560 Thanks.
6192355000895877 They're not dolls. They're people just like me.
6192355000877559 Near-human, you must act. These doll cocoons may one day become real, and need your help.
6192355000895852 I can see that.
6192355000895855 As long as people stay indoors, they're not in danger.
6192355000895858 Isn't it kind of rude to talk about her in the third person like she can't hear you?
6192355000895851 This person lives, but mortal peril looms. The sand pest chokes their district, floods the streets.
6192355000895854 …What? I never thought immunity could be measured in centimeters.
6192355000895866 I know, Reflection. You don't need to explain further.
6192355000895853 Immunity protects each person here. Some have a long one; others, but a short. The span of one's is long; another's, short.
6192355000895857 Yeah. We should do everything we can to find that out.
6192355000895856 Walls <i>can</i> protect—but people still breathe air. The window sashes aren't the most secure. Some mice and bugs creep in to houses, too. And no one knows just how the plague is spread.
6192355000895860 Fair enough.
6192355000895859 She is one person; you are another. And I, the third, must speak this way. But <i>are</i> we people, all of us, you think? 
6192355000895862 To the maximum?
6192355000895865 …By raising their immunity, yes. I'm not completely clueless, you know.
6192355000895861 A dice roll makes a clearer picture, sir: At midnight, Death will roll his dice to see if he rolls high, this one will perish; if he rolls low, they live one day more. Your part, 布拉克, is but to adjust the odds.
6192355000895864 It can't always, but it often does.
6192355000895867 I've heard that Death prefers chess.
6192355000895863 To some degree. If the dice has six sides, you can at times be guaranteed a five. As in—Death always has a chance to win with six. But even Death can't guarantee a six.
6192355000895869 I'm no good at cheating…
6192355000895870 I can cheat? Teach me, then, master gambler.
6192355000895868 You are a doctor—<i>surgeon!</i>—stick with dice! Since you have means to cheat, and Death does not.
6192355000895872 Huh…
6192355000895873 That sounds a bit… hopeless.
6192355000895871 This person weakly rolls a die, the way someone who's barely human would. They can't roll higher than a three without some help. And truth be told, they'll likely roll a one. \nSo you come here and turn the die just so, so that a larger number faces up.
6192355000895876 You sure do love arithmetic.
6192355000895875 Because you are a doctor, and because they do not have your knowledge or your skills. You are two-thirds a person—they are half.
6192355001601542 It's not dice then, it's hide-and-seek.
6192355001601543 I hope there's less of it tomorrow.
6192355001601541 And one more thing. The plague moves stealthily—it has no need to speak of its arrival in a place.\nWhen plague's by windows, people are at risk. But on the morrow other districts will be touched, and you must find them out yourself. So watch the Town's condition close, 布拉克.
6192355001098253 提词人
6192355000880508 What are you celebrating, Khatangher?
6192355000900287 Khayaala? I think it's a fasting period now… Good folks don't eat meat, not until winter.
6192355000880507 Today is Meat Day, tangher. We feast on meat.
6192355000880510 Is it at least fresh?
6192355000893851 I don't eat other people's meat.
6192355000880509 Khatanghe brought meat this morning. Said a warehouse door was left unlocked. So we took some.\n牛老大 维拉德 grows fatter by the day. He works, he takes the profit. So we've decided to take the meat, at least.
6192355000900285 Be khara. I see that.
6192355000900286 Just today? No, I know this town. Every day celebrates meat.
6192355000900284 For them. For us, today is Meat Day.
6192355000900291 All right. Show me the meat.
6192355000900292 So there's a water pump there now? All right, I'll use it. 
6192355000900290 It's cured, kholboön. Who would keep fresh meat in a warehouse?\nAnd if you need to drink, the water is next to the Factory wall, see? Barrel water is the best, brought from the steppe. But in a pinch, you can drink this, too.
6192355000900299 It's stolen.
6192355000900298 But it's good.
6192355000904654 Khatangher
6192355000880512 检查她的腿？做什么？
6192355000900253 你们在非礼这位女性吗，人渣？
6192355000880511 她一定是感到被冒犯了……或是感到羞耻？我们告诉她，她可以走了，但她拒绝了。\n 告诉你，我们是正人君子！我们只检查了她的腿。这是强制性的。她有正常的腿。所以，她现在可以走了！但她站在那里。
6192355000880514 什么刹那？
6192355000900254 还有你是谁？
6192355000880513 既不是泥土也不是骨头。她是一个正常，活生生的女孩，不是一个刹那。所以，她可以走了。\n 但她没有……她一定感到被冒犯了。大草原上的人们有古怪的道德观念。他们不怕死，不肯割人的身体，但为奇怪的事感到羞耻。
6192355000900256 什么家族?
6192355000900257 值班”？但我们这里从来没有见过巡逻员。
6192355000900255 上帝保佑。我们非常尊重她。\n 为什么喊我们“人渣”？我们不是疯狂的暴徒，我们在这里值班。看到皮革帽子了吗？我们属于大家族的人。
6192355000900259 什么怪物？
6192355000900261 我是伊西多·布拉克之子。六年来我我第一次回家。
6192355000900264 我不是你要找的人。
6192355000900258 我们是萨普洛夫的人。\n  三大家族中的每一户都指派了人去寻找怪物。奥吉姆斯基家，当然还有凯恩家。很明显，萨普洛夫家，就是我们。\n 你是谁，好先生？
6192355000900263 我会的。
6192355000900265 你能不能别纠缠这个女孩了？你不会安慰她，你只会让事情变得更糟！走吧。
6192355001140953 再也没有必要向他致以亲切的问候了，夜鹰。他死了。
6192355000900262 他把我女儿从坟墓里拖了出来。我们差点就放弃了她！\n 你告诉他。告诉他，夜鹰彼得向他致以亲切的问候。
6192355000900267 谁下的令？
6192355000900268 有人真的相信这些老太太的传说吗？
6192355000900266 刹那……大草原传说中的生物。他们说大地把它吐了出来。然后它偷走了一个女人的身体，四处残杀别人。\n 当然，听起来挺愚蠢的。但是我们有命令要检查……所以我们就做了。
6192355000900270 好吧。那么你是谁？
6192355000900269 哦，那么你是个外来人？你可以在这里看到各种各样的东西。这里的大地是特别的…它能呼吸。
6192355000900272 骨和泥，对吧。我记得那个故事。
6192355000900275 好好猎捕吧，伙计们。至少现在你们不必去寻找鬼魂，或者domovye。
6192355000900271 一个大草原生物，一个傀儡，一个泥魔女。它偷走了一个女人的形体。但它的腿仍然是泥土或骨头，所以你可以辨别。
6192355000901451 夜鹰
6192355000889874 你是谁？
6192355000889875 You are indeed relieved for now.
6192355000889873 Hey, Gubar! The doctor's here, our shift's over.
6192355000889877 How so?
6192355000889878 You're both alive—so you're equally lucky.
6192355000889876 Grigory Gorky, Orderly #6. Even number, unfortunately.\nMy partner, Avrely Gubar, is luckier.
6192355000889880 Curious… Any explanation for this?
6192355000889881 I'll add it to my collection of superstitions.
6192355000889879 Exactly. Death follows even numbers, didn't you know?\nWe've been keeping tabs on this statistic for a while now. Wherever there's a two, there's the grim reaper.
6192355000889883 Okay. What's today's job?
6192355000889882 It's 'cause suffering tears the soul in two! And death keeps an eye on such moments.\nPah! But that's all just poetry. What I'm saying is, where there's an even number, someone dies. Even numbers are just unlucky.
6192355000889886 An hour?
6192355000889885 To check this exact theory. But you ain't in danger, doctor, 'cause you're the one and only! And death avoids ones. It's afraid to prick its finger on 'em.\nAll in all, you just gotta wait here for an hour until you're relieved.
6192355000889888 I have everything I need.
6192355000889889 Wait a bit. I'll resupply and come back here.
6192355000889887 You got enough medicine? Any protective clothing? Even a piece of cloth would do.\nThe air here is thick; breathing it is like eating infection with a spoon. A really big one.
6192355000889891 I'm not.
6192355000889892 Watch your tone.
6192355000889890 Good.\nWe won't lock the door, out of respect. Resolve is only heroic as long as there was a choice. But doctor 布拉克 is not the type to run away. Are you?
6192355000889894 I'll be quick.
6192355001514054 Fair enough.
6192355000889893 ...Oops. My deepest apologies. That was merely a polite turn of phrase.\nOur shift is over, so we can't wait here anymore. We don't make the rules. So we're leaving. The rest is up to you: either wait for an hour or scurry out the door... failing is an option too, after all.
6192355000889852 
6192355000889895 Orderly
6192355000891175 What are you doing here?
6192355001531855 People are working here, not taking confessions. Get out.
6192355000891174 I can't do it… I can't do anything!
6192355000891177 But in truth, you don't?
6192355001531852 I'm surprised his 士官s even let you near him.
6192355001592762 The general believed you? 布洛克将军? No way.
6192355000891176 I wanted to convince the general… He was the only one who believed me! He did! Don't you see? Just him! His 士官s looked at him as though he'd become a different person. As though talking to me stained him somehow…\nBut he did! And I wanted to prove… to show I have a healing touch.
6192355000891179 So you've promised your general you'll cure someone? Get rid of the plague completely?
6192355000891180 Did it… really work before?
6192355000891178 I do… But something's wrong with me today. It doesn't work!
6192355000891182 Really. I have a cure.
6192355000891183 But that would be a trick. You won't actually be the one doing the healing. Is that fine by you? I thought you were so righteous.
6192355000891181 Really?\nI only need to cure a single person… Just a single one!
6192355000891185 Give hope to whom? That commander of yours? Or his 士官s?
6192355000891186 Don't sin, then. Tell them the truth: there is a salvation, and it's in Doctor 布拉克's hands.
6192355000891184 A trick… Tricking others is wrong. For me, anyway.\nBut giving them hope is more important. Showing that there is a salvation. And if that means I have to sin, well… it's… it's all right, I guess. Their souls are more important than mine.
6192355001531856 I know. Any doctor knows.
6192355000891188 Fine. I'll help.
6192355000891187 No! These poor souls… Even if only one gets better, the rest will hope, and cling to life, and thus endure and survive.\nPeople only die when they resign themselves and give up. Didn't you know?
6192355000891191 You won't like it. A children's "shmowder."
6192355000891192 A panacea. That's what people call it. I made it myself.
6192355000891193 I've got nothing on me right now, but I'll find a healing item for him. You stay here and try your method again.
6192355000891190 What will you treat him with?
6192355000891195 So you've promised your general you'll cure someone? Get rid of the plague completely?
6192355000891194 Of course!
6192355001531854 And yet today you don't. How convenient.
6192355001531853 Why do you all hate me so much? You think I'm a liar? I'm not! I've always had a healing touch!
6192355001592764 You're mad… but there is a way.
6192355001592763 Yes.
6192355000891151 
6192355000891172 克拉拉
6192355000913952 Out? Why not use the gate then?
6192355000917833 为什么？ Is there a fire or something?
6192355000913951 It was an accident, I swear… She was trying to get out, not fall down. She held so tight...
6192355000913954 A strike? Finally.
6192355000917834 Still… Why not use the window on a lower floor?
6192355000913953 The Termitary got locked in, didn't you know? 奥吉姆斯基's orders. Rumor has it, the workers were on a strike.
6192355000917836 A third of the Town works for the Bull Enterprise. Are they <i>all</i> inside?
6192355000917835 People are like sunflower seeds to 大 维拉德. He extracts their lifeblood like oil. They've had enough, they've had it with working both day <i>and</i> night shifts so often.\nSo he locked them in, to keep it contained… to protect the Town. Or we'd have a riot…
6192355000917838 It doesn't bode well.
6192355000917842 Huh.
6192355000917837 Like beasts in a cage.
6192355000917840 Worse?
6192355000917841 A strike seems… uncharacteristic for them.
6192355000917839 That's 'cause the workers are on the edge! They're steppe people, not animals! They also have feelings, they too want to live… but it gets worse for them by the year.

6192355001374458 
6192355001594810 You're late!
6192355001594811 You do that. I need a breath of fresh air…
6192355000891653 Greetings, Doctor 布拉克. I came to relieve you of your duty.
6192355001482166 If I must.
6192355001482167 Not today. My shift is over.
6192355001482165 Apologies for the mishap.\nThe times we live in… are growing shorter, did you notice? Minutes have become shorter; hours, less productive. I guess the Cathedral is broken… Don't get angry.\nBut enough small talk. Or would you like to stay on duty a while longer?
6192355001482169 While I "still can"? Sounds like a threat.
6192355001482173 Good luck with your shift, orderly.
6192355001482168 It's not allowed, anyway. If it's our duty now, that means it's our duty indeed. Take a stroll while you still can, doctor; you're free until tomorrow.\nOrderly number eleven, reporting in.
6192355000891651 
6192355000891652 
6192355001503565 Orderly
6192355000923760 They are.
6192355000923761 你是谁？
6192355000923762 I'm curious what's out there.
6192355000923759 Why are you leaving? Aren't they waiting for you in the Town?
6192355000923764 Don't tell me what to do. It's up to me.
6192355000923765 You're right… I'll return here later.
6192355000923766 All I want is some quiet and emptiness.
6192355000923763 Go back to the Town, 阿泰米 布拉克. The steppe will call for you. Maybe even tomorrow. But now you're needed home. You've nothing to do here yet.
6192355000923768 What do you want, reflection?
6192355000923767 A reflection.
6192355000923770 Happy to hear that.
6192355000923771 Who knows…
6192355000923769 Do you think the steppe's changed over the six years that you haven't been here? This earth is alive still; even a thousand years is but a moment to her.

6192355000896666 This is my house.
6192355000896665 Who's that over there? Limp along, hobo. This house is ours. Get your loot elsewhere. Lotta free houses still standin'.
6192355000896668 Yes, I object.
6192355000896669 Are there many of you?
6192355000896667 No, it ain't. It's ours. Objections?
6192355001175156 Yeah, five is enough. Got you!
6192355001175157 Well, you keep your watch.
6192355001175155 We ain't need a sixth.

6192355001251151 Burglar
6192355000898552 Bayarlaa, noukherne. How much do you want for it?
6192355000909364 Why would I want a bull?
6192355000898551 Hey, noukherne! Be khara, you are a good man. Buy my bull.
6192355000909366 Cheap indeed. Is it stolen?
6192355000909382 I don't have that much.
6192355000909365 It's as good as free. Three hundred.
6192355000909368 Can it talk then?
6192355000909371 Forget bulls! Be khara, you could sell air.
6192355000909367 It's not just any bull. It brings luck. When the time comes, it'll tell you what to do.
6192355000909370 How come?
6192355000909369 You offend me, Khatangher. Not stolen; it's just that money is needed more than bulls these days.
6192355000909373 That's funny logic, like you believe your own tall tale. The scary day will come if you have a bull or not. It's not his life, but yours.
6192355000909374 To be honest, I think you're just a swindler, noukherne.
6192355000909379 So you're selling a curse on four legs? Great. I'll take if from you if <i>you</i> pay <i>me.</i>
6192355000909372 Unente, it is known: it will talk on the scariest day of your life, showing you the right way.\nEh, kharaldaa, I'd rather not have it at all. Perhaps there won't be a scary day in my life, then.
6192355000909377 You're out of your mind, Khatangher. Find yourself another fool.
6192355000909380 I don't even have a place to keep it.
6192355000909375 Take him for two hundred. It's a good bull. Be khara, it'll be useful to you.
6192355000909384 You mean the scariest day of my life? Nah, not interested.
6192355000909385 That was funny, khayaala. Go sell your bull to 大 维拉德. He has a lot of money.
6192355000909386 Fine. Here's the money. We'll see if you keep your word.
6192355000909383 Pay me now, and I'll bring it to your place later. There'll come a day when you'll be grateful to me!
6192355000943193 Oh my. How do you know this?
6192355000943197 Bayarlaa to you for this news, Khatangher. I won't buy your bull; I'd rather spend my money on other things today.
6192355000943192 Prices will rise two times tomorrow. Four times, a day after that. And Suok knows what will happen two days after tomorrow. I need to stock up today.
6192355000943195 You <i>are</i> a funny man, noukherne!
6192355000943196 Huh?
6192355000943194 Don't laugh, but… my bull told me.
6192355001097773 I do. Hand over the bull.
6192355001097778 Nah. I just wanted to take one more look at a talking bull.
6192355001097772 Shee yuunde yereebshe, why are you back? Or do you have the money?
6192355001097775 I don't live where my 父亲 used to.
6192355001097779 Fair enough. I can't walk around with a bull, after all.
6192355001131787 I don't even <i>have</i> a doorstep.
6192355001097774 I'll bring it to your doorstep.
6192355001097777 Oh, 萨巴… She shouldn't have.
6192355001097780 And please clean it up before you bring it to me.
6192355001097776 The Khatangher know where you live. 萨巴-ötün speaks to her people. They need a menkhu, so they need to know how to find you.
6192355001131789 How will you know where I'll find a place? From the bull, too?
6192355001131790 <i>If</i> I find one.
6192355001131788 Then I'll bring it to you when you find one.
6192355001131783 Loy
6192355001149552 So, got anything to say?
6192355001180756 Booha, oh booha… Yamar berkhe! You're a surly one, aren't you?
6192355001149551 ....
6192355001180754 Khara bosooly! Got any surprises in store for me? How long do I need to wait? Shake your head, at least.
6192355001180753 Good bull, who's a good bull… Uherney ereed bayna gyy?
6192355001180755 I guess today will be all right, then.
6192355001180752 .....
6192355001519474 I hope you're not about to talk just yet. I guess I should give you a name?
6192355001519473 .....
6192355001519480 I'll call you Noukher. "Partner." So that you won't let me down, khayaala.
6192355001519481 Duugai. "Silent." I hope you remain such.
6192355001519483 Mounkhe, that's what I'll call you. "Eternity."
6192355001519658 No. It's not right to impose a name upon someone. Perhaps you want to introduce yourself…?
6192355001519479 ..... 
6192355001519485 Everyone I'm close with has gone silent. You do the same, Duugai.
6192355001519484 .. ..
6192355001519487 
6192355001519486 
6192355001519654 Yes. It suits you.
6192355001519653 .......
6192355001511957 Look who's back! Where have you been, stranger?
6192355001499777 Back now? Good boy… Have you brought me anything?
6192355001511953 I thought we had become best friends! But the moment I needed you, you vanished! 为什么？ Were you scared of my knife?
6192355001499776 ....
6192355001511959 Don't leave me again, all right? Or I'll have to tether you.
6192355001511960 All right, all right. Who's a good bull? I'm not mad. You just left at a bad time.
6192355001511964 Got anything to say?
6192355001511958 .      .      ..
6192355001511962 If you knew what went on here, you wouldn't have come back. Or is that exactly the reason you did?
6192355001511963 I'd run off too, if I could… but, not yet.
6192355001511961 ... ..
6192355001499779 You've got a thousand-yard stare… Must have seen a lot of shit.
6192355001513355 Shall we sing a song together?
6192355001499778 ....
6192355001513852 <i>…Bohir, bohir, let us dance, a couple merry fellows… Booha shalzha, let us sing, hear a booha bellow…</i>
6192355001513851  ....
6192355001513854 <i>…Ay-ya, booha, ay-ya! Khatar naada hoog-zhoya… Ay-ya, ay-ya! Khatar naada hoog-zhoya.</i> Do you know this song, good boy?
6192355001519472 I guess you're right. Now isn't the time for merry songs.
6192355001513853  ...  .
6192355001513856 Pah. You're boring. Not even touched by music.
6192355001519471 Yeah, I know… I have an ear for music, but the voice, it could use work.
6192355001513855     ....
6192355001509380 Wait, what? Ah, shudher!
6192355001499781 Medene ugye, kharaa ugyb… I don't know, I haven't seen them…
6192355001499780 Ukherney ereed baina gyy?
6192355001510964 Khyyr… Yes, a grave. A tomb. But what do you mean?
6192355001510965 Noukherne… Say more!
6192355001510963 Khyyr…
6192355001510967 "Do not kill." Whom?
6192355001510968 Baygalday, don't be silent…
6192355001510966 Byy alysh…
6192355001510970 Then again, who cares what you say… Here it is, the scariest day of my life.
6192355001510971 You haven't let me down. Bayarlaa, Kindred.
6192355001510969 .....
6192355001165653 Wonder Bull
6192355000899460 What's going on there?
6192355000899459 Would you look at that…
6192355000900303 What bodies?
6192355000900302 That's where the bodies are taken.
6192355000900305 What do you mean?
6192355000900304 Of today's victims. Accidental victims…
6192355000900307 I don't understand…
6192355000900306 The autumn is foul this year. People have gone mad. That's what I mean.
6192355000903052 Onlooker
6192355000899752 …What are you doing here?
6192355000900308 I feel like I've seen you before…
6192355000899751 …So that's the nightmare I had. Can you imagine? Just before I woke up, I told him, "Be on your way then, khayaala! People don't kill people."\nWhat do you want, old man?
6192355000900310 Yes.
6192355000900313 Yes. I'm a doctor.
6192355000900309 What do you mean? We've never seen a dead person before. Have you?
6192355000900312 Fair enough.
6192355000900314 You be on your way, mutts.
6192355000900311 Be on your way then, khayaala. Why poke your nose around?
6192355001042916 That's a tough one.
6192355001042917 Nothing. Everything is fine the way it is.
6192355001042918 Just eat less before you go to sleep, and you'll stop having nightmares.
6192355001042915 Each has two eyes and two ears. Most have one nose and one mouth.\nRiddle me this: If eyes and ears were switched, what would be right? If noses and mouths were switched, what would be fixed?

6192355000907366 You think we've got anything in common, odongh?
6192355000907367 Why are they so hateful?
6192355000907365 If you see a man, run. They're angry today. They kill the likes of you and I.
6192355000907369 Well, you're a Worm. But I'm human.
6192355000907370 Unfortunately, I'm made of flesh and blood, so I'll take that advice.
6192355000907368 We aren't human. We're different.
6192355000907372 What murderer? What's that got to do with me?
6192355000907373 I'll be cautious.
6192355000907374 But the earth doesn't.
6192355000907371 Seeking a murderer. Becoming murderers themselves. This is how a town changes.
6192355000907376 Thanks, Worm. May Mother Boddho keep your footprints warm.
6192355000907377 I can't. My business is at the Town's heart.
6192355000907375 You look like a murderer. Don't delve into the Town's flesh if you want to live. Keep to the outskirts. Fewer people here.
6192355000907379 We could both attack him.
6192355000907380 I am too.
6192355000907381 I'll risk it.
6192355000907378 See that man there, up ahead? Neither of us could beat him on our own. I'm weak today.
6192355000907383 Let's try.
6192355000907384 Forget it. I'll try to sneak by him. Maybe he won't see me.
6192355000907382 Yes. You and I are weak. He's strong. Neither of us would win alone. But together, maybe we can.
6192355000907386 You think?
6192355000907387 So be it.
6192355000907385 Don't even think about it. You're wounded. You're bad at fighting up-close. You'd probably die.
6192355000907351 Odongh
6192355001349351 Odongh
6192355000913590 You think we have anything in common, odongh?
6192355000913591 Why are they so hateful?
6192355000913589 If you see a man, run. Men are angry today. They kill the likes of you and I.
6192355000913593 You're a worm, true. But I am human all right.
6192355000913594 Unfortunately, I am made of flesh and blood. So I'll take your advice.
6192355000913592 We're not human. We're different.
6192355000913596 What murderer? What does it have to do with me?
6192355000913597 I'll be cautious.
6192355000913598 But the earth doesn't.
6192355000913595 Looking for a murderer. Turning into murderers themselves. This is how a town changes.
6192355000913600 Thanks, Worm. Let Mother Boddho keep your footprints warm.
6192355000913601 I can't. I have business at the heart of the town.
6192355000913599 You look like a murderer. Do not delve into the town's flesh in you want to live. Keep to the outskirts. Less people here.
6192355000913588 Odongh

6192355000913958 By whom?
6192355000917751 How do you know?
6192355000913957 Are you 布拉克? Your 父亲's house is being robbed. Right now.
6192355000917753 Who did this to you?
6192355000917766 Let me see.
6192355000917752 How should I know? I only looked from the outside. Even then, I barely got out of there alive. Got cut with a razor, see? And it could have been even worse.
6192355000917755 What about our new patrolmen? Aren't they doing… something?
6192355000917769 The plague has left there? Impossible…
6192355001647058 So one is free to loot the districts abandoned by the plague? That's useful to know.
6192355000917754 People have turned to looting—didn't you know? Houses are being burgled all over the Hindquarters, in the Tanners, in the Skinners. The plague has abandoned those districts. \nEmpty houses, open for thieves. So people barge in—and no one punishes them, no one even frowns! Guess we all have too many other concerns these days…
6192355000917757 Are there many of them?
6192355000917756 Seen it myself.
6192355000917759 I see. I am.
6192355000917760 Will you come with me?
6192355000917758 They guard infected districts. 萨普洛夫 said that's more important than looting. So, are you going?
6192355000917762 Fine. Thanks for the warning.
6192355000917761 No. I respect you, but I won't ever return there. That place is beyond the law now.
6192355000917764 I'll be fine.
6192355000917765 I don't need weapons to deal with bandits.
6192355000917763 Got any weapons? Without 'em that place is… inhospitable.
6192355000917768 What is even the point of robbing it…
6192355000917767 Relax, I'll live. You hurry home!
6192355000917771 Huh…
6192355000917770 And yet it's true. The air is clear. There's no infection there.
6192355001647060 Nothing. So there are looters in 父亲's house, huh?
6192355001647061 A shameless doctor is more useful than a dead one.
6192355001647059 Useful how? What are you up to?
6192355001566754 Do-Gooder
6192355000913960 Be khara, you can protect yourself.
6192355000917773 Why did they run away?
6192355000913959 Hey, kharaldaa... I didn't do anything.
6192355000913962 What do you have here?
6192355000913961 You shouldn't look either.
6192355000917775 What are you doing here, basaghan?
6192355000917774 I don't know. They behaved so strange…
6192355000917777 为什么？
6192355000917778 Are you… kissing the skull?
6192355000917776 I brought my bones here.
6192355000917780 But you haven't done anything wrong. Why were you ashamed?
6192355000917779 I'm not kissing it. It was in my hands, then people ran in. I was embarrassed and hid my face.
6192355000917786 Well, sure… Nothing wrong about any of this.
6192355000917787 You should be more careful with your bones, basaghan. You're acting strange. And people rarely appreciate that.
6192355000917785 I won't explain to you. I did nothing wrong. I just brought my bones here. What's wrong with that? These bones are mine, I didn't steal them! I tell the truth.
6192355000917789 Well… People don't usually toy around with bull skulls.
6192355000917790 Come to think of it, it isn't. So go ahead and do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.
6192355000917788 What's so strange about that? They're the strange ones.
6192355000917792 I believe you, basaghan.
6192355000917793 But I still think you should leave. They might return.
6192355000917791 It will not.

6192355000951152 
6192355000951151 
6192355000951154 I don't know.
6192355000951155 Not me. And I'm not sure what you're talking about.
6192355000951153 Played vigilantes. Attacked people. I've no idea what got into them, losing any semblance of humanity…\nWho screamed murder in the morning? Who rumor-mongered about the clay golem shaped like a woman? Who started murdering people with no due process?
6192355000951157 I have nothing to do with any of this.
6192355000951158 You're a tough one. You should be a 弗尔曼 at the屠宰场.
6192355000951156 Absurdity… How could it happen? How could anyone call themselves human after that?\nGod. Go. Calm down and be on your way.
6192355000951160 Were these the ones who beat girls to death?
6192355000951159 Something happened this night. I'm not sure what exactly, myself.\nThen a rumor spread: a steppe golem had stolen a woman's shape and started to kill. Stone Age idiocy! They beat several steppe girls to death. I wonder if twyre drives folks insane…
6192355000951162 Wow…
6192355000951163 I was also attacked today. Even though I can hardly be confused for a girl.
6192355000951161 They tried. That's all right though; they'll be taken to the 城镇大厅 and dealt with now.
6192355000951165 What is dealt with?
6192355000951164 Everyone calm down, now! No more mob justice!\nWhat the fuck do you want? Everything is dealt with over here. No more blood!
6192355000951167 Calm down. What did they do?
6192355000951168 I'm 阿泰米 布拉克, 伊西多之子. I only arrived today.
6192355000951166 The murderers. It wasn't them. And if it was, it's up for the Judge to decide.\nAre you one of the crazies who can't keep their fists in check?
6192355000923751 
6192355001131781 Kestrel
6192355000923752 
6192355000928157 I am.
6192355000928151 So you're 伊西多之子, huh?
6192355000928156 
6192355000928155 
6192355000928161 Except dirty conscience.
6192355000932557 None of them was a panacea.
6192355000928160 伊西多 could make special potions. Cures for any diseases.
6192355000928184 Yes.
6192355000932551 I can craft them myself.
6192355000928183 Do you have any of his stock left?
6192355000932553 Lucky me.
6192355000932556 Money is worthless now.
6192355000932552 I'd pay good money for them.
6192355000932555 I'll find a better use for them.
6192355000932558 I will.
6192355000932554 Just keep me in mind.
6192355000928180 You're a sly guy.
6192355000932562 Did you know my 父亲?
6192355000928179 Most importantly, I'll never ask you where you got the human organs needed to make these potions. But they make brilliant antibiotics. Today, we buy them at a special price.
6192355000932560 I see.
6192355000932561 Pain is crucial for self-improvement.
6192355000932559 Today we need potions that reduce pain.
6192355000932564 He was.
6192355000932565 Fine. I see you're not the talkative type.
6192355000932563 Everyone did. He was a real man.
6192355000956351 
6192355001154756 Profiteer
6192355001374241 
6192355000943958 I'm in no position to argue.
6192355000943959 One was enough to carry my burdens before.
6192355000943960 You line their boats with them? But they are just coins, made of metal…
6192355000943957 We line our boats with fingernails to make their path smoother. You have become burdensome, menkhu. Too much death, too much trouble in your chest. Too heavy for a boat to carry.\nWe'll need two fingernails.
6192355000943962 …Have your fingernails.
6192355000943964 I don't have two.
6192355001599554 You're exaggerating.
6192355000943961 You didn't carry a whole town on your back before.
6192355001599552 为什么？
6192355001599553 I never expected you of all people to profiteer…
6192355001599551 Where one fingernail was used, now two are needed. We won't accept you in our boats for one anymore.
6192355000943973 What about toenails?
6192355000943974 为什么？
6192355000943975 …Why do you believe me?
6192355000943972 We believe you didn't kill our patriarch. We'll transport you along the Gullet and the Guzzle, the tributaries of the Gorkhon, our kind river.\nBut it will still cost you fingernails. There's no other way.
6192355000943977 Sure. Sorry.
6192355000943976 We've heard this joke too many times. It was never funny.
6192355000943979 I see.
6192355000943980 Fair enough. I'll keep an eye out for you when I have fingernails and want to t拉薇尔 around faster.
6192355000943978 The Gorkhon is a kind river, but its water isn't for humans. You can't drink from the Gorkhon. You ought not walk into it, either.\nWe traverse its edge. It's frightening. We need fingernails, so that we can always return.
6192355000943982 Yeah, well, tell that to the townsfolk.
6192355000943983 Yeah, I remember your sense… thing. Something to do with weight?
6192355000943984 How many of us live here, by the way?
6192355000943981 Because we are ferrymen. We know from which way you came and when.\nThe murders happened at night. You arrived in the morning. We sensed that a new person appeared in the Town. We keep track of that.
6192355000943986 So what?
6192355000943987 Yeah… I forgot.
6192355000943985 No one would believe us. We are ferrymen.
6192355000943989 People are scared of water.
6192355000943988 Yes. In a way.\nWhen you disengage from the Earth and glide over water, you begin to feel the weight of humanity that Mother Boddho carries on her back.
6192355000943991 How do you do this?
6192355000943992 A bad day for our town…
6192355000943990 I can't tell. The unheard of now happens: People kill other people. So the weight shifts, and shifts, and shifts.\n…One more has just died. No… Two more.
6192355000945552 What do you mean, you won't? I'm about to suffocate here…
6192355001583926 Death is everywhere these days.
6192355000945551 Put away your fingernails, 布拉克 the menkhu. Death stands behind your back. We will not carry it on our boats.
6192355001583927 You can carry me into the infection, but not out? And the air won't drive you down, even though it's still infected? Sounds fishy.
6192355000945554 Am I supposed to go back into that hell now?
6192355001583928 Why are you standing here, then?
6192355000945553 Our boats will not leave infected districts. We can carry you into the plague, but not out of it. The air is heavy here. It drives the boat down. If we pull off, we'll sink.
6192355001583930 What am I supposed to do now?
6192355001583929 We are Children of Boddho, 布拉克 the menkhu. Half-Earth, half in the Earth. The plague cares not for us.
6192355001583932 This is a sensible argument. Why didn't you say so from the start?
6192355001583937 You'll still carry it on your own skin.
6192355001583931 The plague accepts everyone, and lets go of no one.\nPerhaps our boats refuse to t拉薇尔 infected water. Or maybe those are just words. Maybe we simply do not want to spread infection.
6192355001583934 All right… What do I do now?
6192355001583938 Your speech is very clear, too. A real townsperson, aren't you…
6192355001583933 When one talks sense, they get begged and bribed. But what use would it be to bribe monsters in magic boats?
6192355001583936 Like I have a choice.
6192355001583939 Hope I can make it…
6192355001583935 Go back on foot, menkhu. The plague is the Earth. One cannot escape it by water.
6192355000962051 Boater
6192355000951170 Who's not home?
6192355000951171 Grim-what?
6192355000951169 Nope. He's not home. The man's at work in the 城镇大厅, they say. He's signing orders to catch all the grim-inals.
6192355000951173 Yeah.
6192355000951174 Why won't you go to the 城镇大厅 yourself then?
6192355000951172 萨普洛夫, the governor. You're here to see him, aren't you?
6192355000951176 And 你是谁 waiting for here?
6192355000951175 I mean, the marauders, the ones who started the hunt in the morning. Did you sleep through it all?
6192355000951178 And what exactly do you want from him? Perhaps I can help?
6192355000951179 He used to be decent, yes… If not a lover of drastic measures.
6192355000951177 It's all crowded now… and mine is a quiet business. I'd rather wait here. He won't listen to me there, but here—anything can happen. He's a good man, overall.
6192355000951181 You're a good kid.
6192355000951182 It's nice to know he's honest.
6192355000951180 Nah… You can't. My old man was seized when they discovered there was a shortage at the Warehouse. Only he wasn't to blame, it's Filin's thieves' doing.\n萨普洛夫's an honest man. He'll set it all straight. Only, it might take them a <i>long</i> time to figure out and release my old man. Afraid his case might slip through the cracks…
6192355000950151 
6192355000950157 Bowman
6192355000959452 Whoa. Sounds important.
6192355001061011 Like hell you are. I know the kind of games you play. I'd be lucky to get out alive…
6192355000959451 Now, lend me your eyes and ears. We trust you, so we'll let you in on the Game.
6192355000959460 What first one?
6192355001061010 All right, I believe you. Now tell me about your game.
6192355000959459 Very much so. We've never ever allowed an adult into the Great Game. It's forbidden. You'll be the first.\n…Or rather the second. Believe me, we wouldn't invite you, if not for that first one.
6192355000959462 What? Are you kidding? Impossible!
6192355001061001 Have you, like, seen them?
6192355000959461 <i>The</i> one. The one everyone's after. The person who's… well… the Old Man… I mean, you 父亲… I mean, you know.
6192355001061003 What items?
6192355001061004 Where did they leave those items?
6192355001061009 Good thinking on Sleepy Head's part.
6192355001061002 All evidence points to this. They leave strange items in our game. Everyone's scared…\nWe wanted to catch them ourselves at first… But Sleepy Head convinced us it was serious. That we need you. Especially since it does concern you.
6192355001061006 What game?
6192355001061005 We've seen whatever they left in our game. That's enough.
6192355001061008 What should I be thinking about, then?
6192355001061017 Yeah, let's get down to business.
6192355001061007 So, lemme explain.\nWe have these caches, lots of them, all over the Town. That's where we leave messages and gifts for one another. It's a test of intuition. If you find one, you get to the next level. It also tests greed… Whoever takes items without giving anything in return, gets kicked out. \nBut that's not important. Not what you should be thinking about.
6192355001061013 Are you for real? Am I supposed to be proud?
6192355001061014 Nope, I'll pass. I've no plans to test my courage…
6192355001061012 Indeed. Indeed, old man! Spot on! Our game seems to be getting dangerous. That's why we're letting you in.
6192355001061016 What murderer?
6192355001061015 It's hard and interesting… Or rather, it was, until a murderer joined it.
6192355001061019 Where did you find those items?
6192355001061018 The murderer left some items tonight. From the Old Man. Bloody… something, and a scary note, saying they know we'll try to catch 'em, that we're reading it, that they see all.\nIt shook me in my boots!
6192355001061021 I do respect rules. I will follow them.
6192355001061026 The Dam… I think I've been there already. I'll take another look.
6192355001061027 The Bowsprit… You mean the cape, right? The Mistress' tombs? I think I've seen your cache. Didn't know it was a part of a game.
6192355001061020 There are two caches nearby: the Dam and the Bowsprit. Go, and you'll see for yourself. \nOnly, if you take from a cache, leave something, too. Respect the rules, or it'll all go south.
6192355001061023 Thanks for waiting.
6192355001061024 All right… Let's play.
6192355001061025 Three groups of kids scattered across the Stone Yard, huh? Got it.
6192355001061022 The players already gather here in the Stone Yard. Next to the caches, I mean. They've already been to the Middle Town and the Earth. Maybe they found something there, too.\nI believe three parties are already here. They might know more… But I don't know where they are. I've been standing here waiting for you to pass by like an idiot.
6192355001098293 Pup
6192355000959464 I'm looking for the murderer, just like you are. As soon as I find them, I won't bother you anymore.
6192355001061038 Barley who?
6192355000959463 Whoa, you're a beast! Whose idea was it to let the muscle in on the Game? What's next, an invitation to Barley the Thug?
6192355000959466 Have you found anything strange?
6192355000959465 Pfft. Yeah, right. No one leaves the Game just like that, not after they're invited. You'd rather crawl in a pillow and jump from a cup.
6192355000959468 Relax, relax. I remember the rules.
6192355001061041 Isn't leaving things voluntary? Your rules are yours, I don't have to follow them.
6192355000959467 In the Gut, under the stairway. You won't miss it.\nAnd don't forget to leave something! We'll check, too! We'll see what kind of player you are. 'Cause we've had a bunch… Remember Firebrand, the cheapskate? He'd take a watch and leave a pencil… Some personality! At least we figured out it was him quick.
6192355001061040 All right. Anything else?
6192355001061039 Well, there's this one… fella. Used to be 坏格里夫's pal, but then they fell out… Barley split away and founded his own gang. A real, no-nonsense affair, unlike 格里夫's circus.\nWe would have suspected the man immediately, but we checked him already.
6192355001098291 Goldfinch
6192355000959470 Have you found anything?
6192355001061036 I got it, I got it. I'm quick on the uptake. Just telling you 'cause you wanted to know more about me.
6192355000959469 So that's what he looks like. Behold, folks.\nSo here's what we want you to know: don't let yourself think we'd let you in on the Game just 'cause you're pretty. No one's happy that we had to do it. Got it? No one knows you yet. And if you spill the beans to any grown-up. you'll mess it all up. Got it?
6192355000959476 Will you calm down… You distrustful chipmunk.
6192355001061037 If you ever talk like that to me again, I'll spank you. Got it?
6192355000959475 Go to the Gut. You'll find a cache there in the boulders, next to a threshing machine.\nJust be sneaky, all right? Don't let anyone see you. Got it?
6192355000959480 See you.
6192355000959479 Look in the Gut, in the boulders, next to a threshing machine.
6192355001098294 Tatochka
6192355000959472 I'm here about the caches…
6192355001061028 She's dead. She was only terrifying while she lived.
6192355000959471 Tread lighter, will you? Or you'll wake up the Mistresses. 维多利亚 would be fine, but what if you disturbed 妮娜?
6192355000959474 I'll do my very best.
6192355001061029 How do you even play this game?
6192355000959473 Yeah, we know. Sleepy Head told us you were in.\nHere's one cache. We found odd things inside. Play well, will you? Don't let us down.
6192355001061031 What makes you think I'll replace him?
6192355001061032 Fair enough.
6192355001061030 It's a game of trust. You'll figure it out as you play. And we'll figure <i>you</i> out.\nEveryone's wondering what the Old Man's replacement will be like.
6192355001061034 Eh.
6192355001061035 See you, kiddos.
6192355001061033 We sometimes get together in the Nutshell. It's like… a place. We go there in the evening, in the morning, even at noon. All in all, we come and go as we please.\nIf you get a lead, go to the Nutshell, will you? You'll find <i>someone</i> there. Eh?
6192355001098292 Ace
6192355000959488 What inspection?
6192355000959489 So barrels have guards standing over them now?
6192355000959487 An inspection, eh? 'Tis all silliness, if you ask me. The water is all right. People drank it, and no one died.
6192355001257868 You've lived long enough to have wrinkles, yet you still believe someone would infect people on purpose?
6192355001257869 So the Kin is to blame for everything? Great. Go on, tell me more. I'm all ears.
6192355001257870 What a lady… Always up to all sorts of mischief, despite the bone legs!
6192355001257867 Rumor is, steppe people infected the barrels last night. Don't take offense, sir! Might also have been the plague-bearer, the bone-legged wench. \nRemember the hunt for her? Well, where there's smoke, there's fire. Guess there was a good reason behind the hunt, after all.
6192355001257874 So what does that professor of yours say?
6192355001257875 If you don't believe it, 你是谁 protecting the barrel from?
6192355001257873 Don't make fun of me, doctor. You live to my age, you'll sing a different tune.\nEven the professor from the Capital, a book smart man, isn't laughing anymore. He realizes now our traditions should be respected. Yeah… You don't have to believe them deep down, but show some respect.
6192355001257877 What would be the point, if it's already infected?
6192355001257876 Oh, I don't! But an order came through this morning, barrels must be guarded—as many as we have manpower to guard. Tough that the Master is the only one with enough free men…\nMaybe it's to protect the water from someone infecting it, too. Can't be too sure.
6192355001257879 The Gorkhon flows in the opposite direction!
6192355001257883 Sounds bad… So now what?
6192355001257878 I've been told to stand guard here, 'cause those are our last sips of clear water. The water pipes were destroyed last night. The fools decided the infection's waterborne, from the Gorkhon.\nIt's polluted, true, with blood and innards from the屠宰场.
6192355001257881 Doing your best to drive everyone nuts, aren't you?
6192355001257882 Sounds right. Dying of thirst is better than dying of sand pest. Less tortuous.
6192355001257880 Master's orders. Very thoughtful of him. And 萨普洛夫 issued an order, too. One bottle per person, and not a drop more.
6192355001638960 Let's assume he did. How do I examine one?
6192355001257884 An order's been issued: all barrels are to be examined. If anything suspicious is found, all barrels from that part of town are to be seized. Can't be too sure.\n学者 丹考夫斯基 is in charge of the process. It's all up to him. Hence my question: Did he send you to inspect the barrels?
6192355001638962 Could you drag a barrel to a different location for me? It'd be easier to check there. And I don't think I can move a barrel on my own...
6192355001638963 Already running. At breakneck speed.
6192355001638961 Are <i>you</i> asking <i>me,</i> doctor?\nI guess you take a sample. Then... hold it to the light? Taste it? And run to professor 丹考夫斯基 to report if anything is off.
6192355001638965 So you would relocate a suspicious one? Got it.
6192355001638966 I'll inspect barrels first. decide later.
6192355001638967 I have a bad feeling about this...
6192355001638964 为什么？ Examine it here. Unless you find a suspicious barrel... then experiments are mandatory, I guess?
6192355000959491 This barrel is clear. Stand your guard. Water is more precious than gold now.
6192355001248951 You know what, pal? Take this barrel to the cape, to 拉薇尔's house.
6192355000959490 Your decision, doctor?
6192355001248953 For the good of the people.
6192355001257862 Orders.
6192355001257863 Because I told you to.
6192355001248952 Huh? What for?
6192355001257865 All right, all right… Whatever you say.
6192355001257866 It was a test. Well done.
6192355001257864 Eh? And who deserves this treasure, I wonder? For what service?\nNo way in hell! My orders are clear. If the water is clear, it's precious. A bottle per day. For everyone. The Committee's orders. And it's just fair, too.
6192355000959497 I'm not sure. This water is indeed strange. It has this odor… but that doesn't mean anything. Let me think.
6192355000959493 How would I know if it's dangerous? I guess it would be smart to take a sample to 丹考夫斯基. He's the microscope man.
6192355000959496 You know what? Take this barrel to the outskirts, to 拉薇尔's house. I'll examine it there.
6192355000959492 You've gone all pale, doctor… Is everything okay? Is the water fine in this barrel?
6192355001169725 You know what? Take this barrel to the outskirts, to 拉薇尔's house. I'll examine it there.
6192355001653001 Calm down, will you? If I decide there is reason to worry, I'll hurry to 丹考夫斯基 with a sample of water instead of chatting with you.
6192355001169727 No. I'm still thinking. It takes time. Not that you would know.
6192355001169724 So? Did you think it over? Any orders?
6192355001262552 Water Guard
6192355000977552 Yeah… I could use one.
6192355000977564 Pushing me in the direction of bloodshed, huh?
6192355000977551 You are being hunted. You'll need a weapon.
6192355000977554 Peaceful, my ass…
6192355000977562 That's for the best.
6192355000977553 It just so happens that no one carries firearms around these parts. It's a peaceful town.
6192355000977566 Thanks.
6192355000977567 So what do you suggest?
6192355000977565 Like you needed pushing…\nListen, we respected Old 布拉克. You are the only person who can replace him. We don't want to see you dead, too.
6192355000977577 Where did you get it?
6192355000977578 Why can't you just give it to me?
6192355000977576 And it just so happens that I have a revolver. But I can't give it away for free. For a reasonable price, though…
6192355000977580 I do. How much?
6192355000977579 I work in pickling. The Factory stopped working today. We fear it may be the first sign of serious trouble: 大 维拉德 is no charity. He cares little for his workers.\nIf I lose my job, our family is about to have a very rough time. Surely you understand.
6192355000977582 Who is this brave storekeeper?
6192355000977589 Ah, 坏格里夫… Why am I not surprised?
6192355000977592 What's your price?
6192355000977581 Our storekeeper has his way of finding… curios. He orders them from the big world, to be delivered by train, on 大 维拉德's behalf.\nThat's all right. The Master can take it.
6192355000977588 How much for the revolver?
6192355000977587 Forget it. So, are you interested in the deal?
6192355000977591 Are you nuts? I don't have this sort of money.
6192355000977593 Fair enough. Show me.
6192355000977590 Three thousand.
6192355000977595 Inheritance, pah… I suspect I'll have a hard time obtaining it.
6192355000977596 Drop it. I didn't come here for the inheritance, I wanted to see my 父亲!
6192355000977594 I can wait for two days. If you don't take it by then, I'll do business with someone else. My circumstances are humble.\nAs for the money, you'll have no trouble getting it. 伊西多 must have left you inheritance. It's hard to talk about it now, I understand, but business is business.
6192355000977599 Yeah, I know a thing or two about herbs.
6192355000977600 Fine. I'll be back tomorrow, or maybe even today.
6192355000977601 Can I at least take a look at the revolver?
6192355000977598 Secondly, 伊西多 must have taught you how to hear and pick medicinal herbs. They're in bloom now. And merchants in the 破碎之心 would give you a decent price for them.
6192355001697063 Two days... I don't even know what might happen to me in two hours!
6192355001697064 Not a sum easily earned in two days.
6192355001697062 I can wait for two days. If you don't take it by then, I'll do business with someone else. My circumstances are humble.
6192355001697066 Yeah, I know a thing or two about herbs.
6192355001697067 Fine. I'll be back tomorrow, or maybe even today.
6192355001697068 Can I at least take a look at the revolver?
6192355001697065 伊西多 must have taught you how to hear and pick medicinal herbs. They're in bloom now. And merchants in the 破碎之心 would give you a decent price for them.
6192355000982151 Steeper
6192355001374242 
6192355001374243 
6192355001374244 
6192355001374245 
6192355000985052 Should they?
6192355000985053 Wow. Actual hundreds?
6192355000985051 I want to ask 萨巴 how to make all those hundreds of people obey me. It's important! They won't listen!
6192355000985055 Perhaps you should agree to a pony?
6192355000985056 Outrageous.
6192355000985054 I say, "Stop knocking!" But they knock. I say, "Let me take a look at all my domain!" But they won't. I say, "I want a new calf!" They bow silently and walk out. But I don't need a bow! I need a calf!
6192355000985058 Then better ask 萨巴 to teach you numbers.
6192355000985059 Even more? Who are those people?
6192355000985057 Well… more. But I can only count to a hundred for now.
6192355000998553 Is that so? 为什么？
6192355000998554 你是谁, khetey?
6192355000998552 I loved your 父亲, emshen. Few did. All he got was respect.
6192355000998556 But you did, huh?
6192355000998557 Yes. That's the kind of man he was.
6192355000998555 He wanted change. Bothered those who feared change. Made them feel anxiety and pain. Few people liked it.
6192355000998559 So what do you want from me, khetey?
6192355000998560 Sounds great. Can't say that many people want to be my friends these days.
6192355000998558 Your 父亲 made me. Created me out of clay, so to speak. He's the one who called me 萨巴. Before that, I was Usp'tae. Few liked that.\nI am evil, emshen. People fear me. And for a good reason, too. But I can see your 父亲 in you, so I will be your trusted friend, kholboön.
6192355000998562 I… I didn't even know.
6192355000998563 I had no time.
6192355000998564 I was in jail. Arrested yesterday.
6192355000998561 I've been looking for you for a while. Where were you? What were you doing? Why haven't you come to bury your 父亲?
6192355000998566 你是谁？
6192355000998568 I saw you. Back there, at the funeral.
6192355000998565 Follow me, emshen.
6192355000998570 他还给我留了遗产？
6192355000998571 I don't. Leave me alone.
6192355000998569 你不想接受你父亲的遗产吗？
6192355000998573 Let's go.
6192355001594808 Not right now. I'll drop by later. I guess.
6192355000998572 He did. Be khara, this is the most important thing to ever happen to you. Let's go.
6192355000998575 A shame indeed.
6192355000998576 Needed me? 为什么？
6192355000998574 Shame. He needed you. Waited for you.
6192355000998578 What do you mean?
6192355000998577 You are his son. How is a man to be buried without his son's will? He was lying in the open for a while. Refused to go into the ground. So we had to give him to the sky.
6192355000998551 艾斯佩蒂
6192355001005464 What for?
6192355001029765 People don't dig holes in this town. Don't you know?
6192355001005463 Hey, uncle… Dig a hole for us, will you?
6192355001029769 Are you burying a cat?
6192355001029783 No, kids. You know full well that I can't.
6192355001029768 Please, uncle… We only need a shallow one! A couple of shovel swings, nothing more!
6192355001029771 Then whom?
6192355001029770 Yeah. I mean… no. Not a cat.
6192355001029773 Huh? The eighth what?
6192355001029772 Just… the Eighth.
6192355001029775 I guess shallow ones are allowed… All right. I'll dig you a hole.
6192355001029776 No, kids. One should not dig holes in the ground. Period.
6192355001029774 Well, the previous seven are already pushing the daisies. And nothing bad happened when we buried them! Because the holes were shallow.
6192355001029778 I don't think you do.
6192355001029780 This is actually hard work. What would be my reward?
6192355001029777 We need it.
6192355001029782 Are you burying a cat?
6192355001029781 A burial gift. Everyone gets to take something away from a funeral. That's why we're holding it!

6192355001042951 
6192355001188551 Funeral Attendant
6192355001005468 Perhaps I can help?
6192355001005469 What are you doing here?
6192355001005470 What's your name, girl?
6192355001065651 Fancy meeting you here… I was just looking for you!
6192355001005467 You've interrupted a difficult conversation. I think you should leave.
6192355001005472 Fine. I'm leaving then.
6192355001005473 You are two serious girls…
6192355001005471 I understand there are things you want to know. You think we might tell you, if you ask right. But we won't. Not now. You're an interloper.
6192355001005475 I'd like to know more.
6192355001005476 All right. I'm leaving.
6192355001005474 Parleying. It's our business.
6192355001065653 I'll be quick. I was just wondering...
6192355001065654 All right.
6192355001065652 I'll return back to my place soon. That is where we'll talk.
6192355001010152 卡佩拉
6192355001005478 What argument?
6192355001005479 What's it to you?
6192355001005477 So why did you interrupt our argument?
6192355001005481 Not really.
6192355001005482 I do.
6192355001005480 There used to be two Mistresses, right? 妮娜 and 维多利亚. One burned; the other soothed. 妮娜 died, so 卡特琳娜 replaced her. Then 维多利亚 died, and 卡特琳娜 was torn apart. Now there are no more mistresses. The Town is unprotected. Do you follow?
6192355001005484 It changes constantly.
6192355001005485 I'm terse, actually.
6192355001005483 <i>Q.E.D.</i> \nBut it's none of your concern, 布拉克. So you bumped into us accidentally, whatever. But why couldn't you keep your big mouth shut? Don't you understand that words have power? You utter a word 'cause you're bored, and the whole future changes.
6192355001005487 And the lucky one will be you, of course.
6192355001005488 It sounds crazy.
6192355001005486 妮娜 and 维多利亚 are dead. 卡特琳娜 is incapable. So their daughters are coming into power. There have always been two Mistresses. Now there are three of us. That's too many. Only one will remain. Do you get just how important that is?
6192355001005490 Maybe I should go back to them and tell them of your good intentions.
6192355001005491 Good luck, then.
6192355001005489 Perhaps.
6192355001005493 Nope.
6192355001005494 Well, now I'll go back and talk to the girls just to spite you. I love meddling with the future.
6192355001005495 It's not your doing. I wasn't always able to speak to who I wanted to before, either.
6192355001005492 Listen carefully, 布拉克. Look at me. I will make it so that you can only talk to people when it doesn't interfere with my plans. This is your first warning. If you get in my way again, I'll take your speech away completely. Got it?
6192355001005497 You're a funny girl…
6192355001005498 I do believe you. Take pity on my poor soul.
6192355001005496 Oh, so you don't believe me? Be my guest. Go back and talk to the girls, then. Or try to.
6192355001005500 That's my job.
6192355001005501 We're good at both. You'll see.
6192355001005499 Listen to me! You're doing the wrong thing! You're getting in everyone's way. You rip a very delicate web with your rough paws. You 布拉克s are only good at tearing, never connecting. Ripper…
6192355001005503 I think you're confusing yourself with God.
6192355001005504 How will I know who you have plans for?
6192355001005502 Do you need me to explain like you're two? You approach someone I have a plan for. You try to talk to them. And nothing happens. Your mouth won't open. Clear now?
6192355001005506 Fair enough.
6192355001005507 Thanks for the fun.
6192355001005505 By trying and failing to talk to them.
6192355001010151 克拉拉
6192355001005509 I just wanna ask something…
6192355001038751 I'm here on important business.
6192355001005508 Where do you think you're going, buddy?
6192355001038753 I'm not here to join the watch. I'm a doctor.
6192355001038758 Whatever.
6192355001038752 Everyone here wants to ask something.
6192355001038755 Must be nice to have all time in the world.
6192355001038759 Get off my case.
6192355001038754 I don't give a damn. Wait for your turn like everyone else.
6192355001038757 I'm not here to join the watch!
6192355001038756 Everyone is here on important business.
6192355001188552 Volunteer
6192355001005511 Am I banned because I'm a doctor? I should be free to do whatever I want.
6192355001038772 为什么？ Did you run out of leather caps? I can get my own.
6192355001005510 Greetings. I am sorry to inform you that you're officially banned from joining the watch. Governor's orders.
6192355001038774 Enough blabbering. I'd rather speak to 萨普洛夫 himself. Is he inside?
6192355001038775 How many times do I have to say it? I'm innocent!
6192355001038773 I would like to remind you that you're currently on probation. Until the murderer of 西蒙 凯恩, 伊西多 布拉克, and several others is brought to justice, you're still considered a suspect. There's evidence against you.
6192355001038779 What house?
6192355001038778 Yes, I am here about the house.
6192355001038777 Are you here about the house?
6192355001038781 I guess it is now…
6192355001038782 I'm here about something else.
6192355001038780 Your own, of course. \nOn governor's orders, it was locked down during the investigation of 伊西多 布拉克's death. Since the investigation's over, the governor can grant you access. Isn't that why you're here?
6192355001188553 Manager
6192355001005513 Why is that?
6192355001038764 Yeah, it's about time.
6192355001005512 萨普洛夫 sure seems ready to take up the reins of power. It's about time, if you ask me.
6192355001038761 In my experience, people respond better to kindness.
6192355001038765 Speaking of strength… How do I join the town watch?
6192355001038760 Because you can't trust people, that's why! The rule of the three families was about trust—in each other and in the townsfolk. The damned nobles trusted people to govern themselves. \nAnd the people? They are unruly beasts. They don't respond to kindness, only strength.
6192355001038763 There's no point in arguing with you lot…
6192355001038768 It wasn't kindness that killed those people.
6192355001038769 I can see your point.
6192355001038762 Our rulers were kind and lenient. Where did it get us? Yesterday blood flowed like water, and a woman was burned to death at the Bone Stake Lot!\nTrust! Pah! Leniency leads to corruption. What we need is someone who can keep the rabble in check.
6192355001038767 Why does 萨普洛夫 need so many people?
6192355001038766 Open your eyes, the line is right there.
6192355001038771 So you think people are unworthy of trust?
6192355001038770 To maintain order, of course. To prevent yesterday's nightmare from ever happening again.\n奥吉姆斯基 only cares about what he owns. The 凯恩s treat the whole Town as family—no wonder they got soft. Now, they're all getting their comeuppance.
6192355001188554 Onlooker
6192355001005515 What's that mold?
6192355001046151 "Rough as dutch, safe to touch. Smooth as bone, leave it alone."
6192355001005514 It does seem rough to the touch. Have you tried? They say it is. Even if it doesn't look it. Looks greasy, though.\nIt's like that saying, what was it…
6192355001046153 What is this… mold?
6192355001046154 Right.
6192355001046152 Yeah, that one…\nOnly, I always thought it was about the road less taken and such? "Rough" means a hard choice; "smooth," taking an easy path. And we all know where those lead… Right?
6192355001046156 Like I know.
6192355001046159 Soot would spread evenly. And this is some sort of mold.
6192355001046155 Who knows. Something's wrong with the air. This must be it. Some sort of soot from the Factory… Guess that's why it was shut down.\nOnly… it's growing fast, and the tinge is wrong. I wonder what they used for fuel there…
6192355001046158 Sure. No need to take pointless risks.
6192355001046160 And who is that, touching this thing? That can't be a good idea! "Rough as dutch…"
6192355001046157 I really should leave this place, breathing this soot can't be healthy… Right?
6192355001098276 Lefty
6192355001005517 But the house isn't alive.
6192355001046163 What doctor was that?
6192355001005516 The house is all sick. Must be shingles.\nVerochka had shingles last year. Mom thought it was the coughs, but then the doctor said it was just shingles. "Rash shingles." Got it from a cat. That's what he said.
6192355001046162 Come on. It's made of stone and wood.
6192355001046177 …Ah. Still my same old hometown.
6192355001046161 谁告诉你的？ All the houses are alive around here.
6192355001046165 No, he won't. You'll have to come to me now, with your shingles and measles.
6192355001046167 Thanks, kiddo. This is great advice. If I ever get sick, I'll go right to him.
6192355001046164 Grand父亲 伊西多. He's a good doctor. He gave Verochka an ointment from herbs and ground stuff, and she got better in a week. Only we had to cut her hair.\nIf you ever get sick, go to him. He'll cure you in a second.
6192355001046169 Of course I believe you.
6192355001046176 When I was your age, everything talked to me too…
6192355001046168 Nuh huh. They can breathe and talk. For real! Don't you believe me?
6192355001046171 Don't mind me.
6192355001046172 So you're saying the house is sick, huh?
6192355001046170 Why did you get all sad all of a sudden?
6192355001046174 But a house isn't alive. It can't get sick.
6192355001046175 I don't think it's soot, either. I think it's mold.
6192355001046173 Can't you see? Dad says it's soot. But I don't think it's soot.
6192355001042952 
6192355001098275 Hatchling
6192355001042851 Depends on who you are.
6192355001042858 I'm on my own.
6192355001005520 Look alive, brothers and sisters! This one is in cahoots with 诺克金's crew. So tell me, old man… Which side are you really on?
6192355001042857 So, you're the good guys, and they're the bad?
6192355001042861 I see. Got a little war on your hands, eh?
6192355001042865 You know, I think I got it. You've explained it pretty well.
6192355001042856 We're the Dogheads, and they're the Soul-and-a-Halves. We're above, and they're below. We live in the Tower, and they crawl in the Earth. They're drawn to animals, and we reach for the stars. What's so hard to comprehend?
6192355001042860 How does that even work?
6192355001042862 I don't feel dumb.
6192355001042859 Are you dumb? This isn't a game of cops and robbers, it's serious stuff. They're pulling the Town one way, and we, another.
6192355001042864 So if they want to be beasts, why are you the ones wearing the dog masks?
6192355001042870 Can't you just leave them alone?
6192355001042863 That's our great conflict, old man. The Soul-and-a-Halves see our Tower as the root of all evils, and we can't live without it. The Tower makes people into super-people. The Soul-and-a-Halves would rather become mindless pets.
6192355001042867 And what's with the four on one?
6192355001042866 For a good reason. These masks remind us we're still beasts, and the true humans inside us are yet to come out. They can't see well, are almost deaf, and speak only in gibberish. Lots of room left for growth.
6192355001042869 As I see it, there's a fight brewing here. What's the problem, kids?
6192355001042868 What do you even want, big man? Have you come to drag us home? Tough luck. We're going home when we want and not a minute earlier.
6192355001042872 And what's with the four on one?
6192355001042871 It's <i>they</i> who won't leave <i>us</i> alone. Day after day they lure our guys outside and take them down.
6192355001042874 Why did you drive him up there like a cat up a tree…?
6192355001042877 Aren't you upstanding citizens.
6192355001042873 First off, it's four on one and a Half. He does have half a soul more than ordinary folk. Second, we're not here to kick his ass. They're the ones keen on bashing us with clubs and worse.\nUs, we're a peaceful bunch. We fight only in self-defense.
6192355001042876 I've had my fill of such "teachers."
6192355001042878 You don't mind if I go upstairs and talk to him too, do you?
6192355001042875 We're teaching him discipline. He should get used to heights.
6192355001042880 Great. See ya.
6192355001042881 I find the down below no less fascinating.
6192355001042879 Go ahead, who's stopping you? See for yourself—the higher you go, the better it gets.
6192355001042883 That's not all there is.
6192355001042884 Can't argue with that.
6192355001042882 Pfft, yeah, right. Have fun with all the stiffs and maggots around you.
6192355001012252 Chara
6192355001005523 You kids play curious games these days… Our times were simpler.
6192355001042885 Will they beat you if you get down?
6192355001042898 That you're in team "no heights."
6192355001005522 So what did they tell you?
6192355001042887 Do you need help?
6192355001042888 And they said there's more than one of you here. But I only see you.
6192355001042886 Hell if I know…
6192355001042890 So, a huge fight is brewing, huh?
6192355001042904 You're one of 诺克金's, right? We had a curious conversation yesterday.
6192355001042889 My half went to the Warehouses to call for help.
6192355001042892 So you gather at the Cargo Station?
6192355001042910 Yeah, I've heard.
6192355001042891 That's all right. All will be quiet when we gather at the Station this evening. That's our no man's land. A good place.
6192355001042894 Are you sure you don't need my help?
6192355001042901 Oh, I see. So how bad do you beat them?
6192355001042902 Maybe I can parley peace between your two factions?
6192355001042893 It used to be peaceful. Each gang only mingled with their own. But recently, it escalated into outright war. To be honest, we struck first… but that's 'cause they got under our skin.\nYou be on your way, big man. Adults have no business with our wars.
6192355001042896 As you wish.
6192355001042897 To be fair, it's beautiful up here…
6192355001042895 We'll manage on our own.
6192355001042900 I see. Do you need help?
6192355001042903 You're one of 诺克金's, right? We had a curious conversation yesterday.
6192355001042899 I'm in team freedom. And our team dislikes zealots. We don't appreciate being dragged by the collar to turn into angels, or wind, or whatever… All in good time.
6192355001042906 So they come to preach, and you answer with sticks?
6192355001042907 I see… Damn this war.
6192355001042905 诺克金 does everything right. Fast on the draw. His 父亲 got killed in the war, mom died during childbirth. Most of our lot are orphans. That's why we're tough.
6192355001042909 If you don't like me, I'll leave and won't ever return.
6192355001042913 I'll just peek with one eye.
6192355001042914 Fair enough.
6192355001042908 Stop prying. Grown-ups are not welcome where we gather. You ruin everything.
6192355001042912 I'll drop by, if that's fine by you.
6192355001042911 At the Passenger one. We used to gather at the Cargo, it was cooler. But now it's all boarded off. You'll only end up with broken legs, and we've got girls and little kids there, too… So now we gather at the platform.
6192355001012251 
6192355001014951 Smokey
6192355001005525 How long ago did it break?
6192355001065666 Well, that can be fixed.
6192355001005524 …It doesn't work.
6192355001065665 Why do you keep it then?
6192355001065672 Would you like me to fix it for you?
6192355001065664 It's always been like this.
6192355001065668 Oh, no… My toys were much simpler.
6192355001065669 No. But I can try.
6192355001065667 Really? Can you fix it? Did you have one of these as a kid?
6192355001065671 Why aren't you in the Tower, too?
6192355001065675 I see.
6192355001065670 Fly brought it from some sort of dumpster. Looong ago. But now Fly lives in the Tower, and he doesn't come to visit anymore…
6192355001065674 I understand. Friends are important.
6192355001599576 Do you want me to fix your lamp?
6192355001065673 I dunno… Lisa and Mew are here, so I'm here too… We're friends, after all.
6192355001005527 This is our town.
6192355001065676 This is our history. Its beginning and its current state.
6192355001065677 These are three different worlds in the palm of one hand.
6192355001005526 Whoa! WHOOOA! What is it—? How is it—? Whoa!
6192355001057151 Cricket
6192355001005529 Hungry?
6192355001060951 Fresh? As in… not ripe?
6192355001060985 Trading nuts for nuts? Now that's profitable.
6192355001005528 Do you have fresh nuts? We can trade them for rare ones.
6192355001060953 Alive?
6192355001060952 Are <i>you</i> nuts? You can't eat nuts! They're alive!
6192355001060955 And what did they have to say?
6192355001060954 You're so dense… We've already heard all these walnuts and chestnuts have to say. So now we can barter them away. The new is always more interesting.
6192355001060957 "Shmowders"?
6192355001060958 Where are they now?
6192355001060956 They told us that we can find shmowders in this very yard. We call it the Powder Bag. Boka and Turochka used to live here. They were the shmowder-makers…
6192355001060960 What are these shmowders good for?
6192355001060959 They grew up and left. A long time ago! No one's been making new shmowders for a while now… The old stock is all we have left. So we're hunting them down.
6192355001060962 What?
6192355001060961 No! Fresh, as in, with fresh people inside!
6192355001060964 You're not allowed to carry needles or knives.
6192355001060980 Can I have one? Or see one, at least?
6192355001060963 They're like… powders. Very valuable. We'll later trade them for needles, or a knife.
6192355001060968 So where are those shmowders of yours hiding?
6192355001060966 No, I don't.
6192355001060967 Ah, now I see. You kids are little criminals.
6192355001060965 You're so dumb! Think we don't know? That's exactly why we need shmowders. Don't you understand?
6192355001060971 Well… All right.
6192355001060974 Why make it so complicated?
6192355001060970 No, I'm not good at hide-and-seek.
6192355001060969 How about we play hide-and-seek? We'll look for powders, and you'll look for us.
6192355001060973 Just to five? Let's see if you're that fast…
6192355001060981 Okay. Ready or not…
6192355001060982 Got it. But no cheating!
6192355001060972 You're it! Turn around, so that you don't see us, and count to five. Then seek!
6192355001060976 I see… Okay, I'll help you.
6192355001060979 Sorry, kids. This is just too complicated for me.
6192355001060975 Shmowders like hide-and-seek, too. They like to see people play. They get curious. Then it's easier to find them!
6192355001060984 Why barter them away then?
6192355001060986 What interesting things? Like, secrets?
6192355001060983 Not all of them, of course. Just the ones that caught someone. A memory, you know? Of a dead person. \nSometimes they tell interesting things. Like ours, they do! You can't imagine how long it took us to get our hands on these...
6192355001059953 Kid
6192355001005533 Hey, this is no place for children. Do you even know what happened here yesterday?
6192355001047305 What are you doing here?
6192355001005532 She's always like that! Always wants to go first! We want to play, too!
6192355001047304 But it's no laughing matter… How can you play this out?
6192355001047314 No. They burned a living person here. Now scram!
6192355001047303 Everybody knows <i>that!</i> They burned a steppe bogeywoman here. A clay wench of herbs and bones.
6192355001047307 Playing what?
6192355001047306 We're playing.
6192355001047310 What kind of game is that?
6192355001047311 It's not a good place for games. Shoo.
6192355001047309 Clay.
6192355001047316 They're curious. Bah!
6192355001047317 It's not curious, kids, it is sad.
6192355001047315 Well… We're curious.
6192355001195653 Bobber
6192355001005535 You're not afraid of fire, are you?
6192355001047318 Not for long, I'm afraid.
6192355001005534 I'll be the witch! I'll be the witch!
6192355001047320 They're going to tie you up and douse you with kerosine. And when you catch fire, they'll get scared and run away. How do you like that?
6192355001047323 I've been sent here. To make sure that everything is for real.
6192355001047319 Huh? What do you mean?
6192355001047322 Spot on! It's not funny! You better go play with dolls. Witch, my ass...
6192355001047324 I'm dead serious.
6192355001047321 Huh?! What do you mean? That's not funny at all!

6192355001097790 Go, go. And take the goddamn bull with you.
6192355001016102 Hey, khayaala! This is my final offer. Buy my bull. I will not return here again, it is time to leave.
6192355001097782 Yamar berkhe. Good job!
6192355001097783 I hope it <i>does</i> talk one day. So you say it'll warn me of danger?
6192355001097781 Sayn bayna, hello, noukherne! See, I brought your bull. Cleaned it up, too. We Khatanghe never swindle one another.
6192355001097785 Don't mention Suok in vain, noukher. It's not a name to say randomly.
6192355001097786 Bayarlaa, khayaala. Thank you. I'll call it "Lucky find."
6192355001097784 It will, noukherne. You believed me, and for that, you'll be rewarded. Mother Boddho and Suok be my witnesses.
6192355001097792 …All right, have it your way. I'll buy it.
6192355001601523 I'd buy it, but I don't have the money on me. Can you wait here?
6192355001097795 Well, I don't. And neither should you. How do you plane to survive alone in the steppe? The winter is at hand.
6192355001097791 The bull told me to. It said, this is my last chance. If I don't leave today, I'll die in four days.\nI believe it.
6192355001097794 I hope it <i>does</i> talk one day. So you say it'll warn me of danger?
6192355001097796 All I want is for you to get off my back, nүnekhen zayla!
6192355001097793 Bayarlaa. You won't regret this.
6192355001601491 Bayarlaa, noukherne. How much do you want for it?
6192355001601492 Why would I want a bull?
6192355001601490 Hey, noukherne! Be khara, you are a good man. Buy my bull.
6192355001601494 Cheap indeed. Is it stolen?
6192355001601495 I don't have that much.
6192355001601493 It's as good as free. Three hundred.
6192355001601497 Can it talk then?
6192355001601498 Forget bulls! Be khara, you could be an air seller.
6192355001601496 It's not just any bull. It brings luck. When the time comes, it'll tell you what to do.
6192355001601500 How come?
6192355001601518 What's so special about your bull?
6192355001601499 You offend me, Khatangher. Not stolen; it's just that money is needed more than bulls these days.
6192355001601502 That's some funny logic, like you're starting to believe your own tall tale. The scary day will come whether you have a bull or not. It's not his life, but yours.
6192355001601503 To be honest, I think you're just a swindler, noukherne.
6192355001601504 So you're selling a curse on four legs? Sweet. I'll take if from you if <i>you</i> pay <i>me.</i>
6192355001601501 Unente, it is known: It will talk on the scariest day of your life, showing you the right way.\nEh, kharaldaa, I'd rather not have it at all. Perhaps there won't be a scary day in my life, then.
6192355001601519 I'd buy it, but I don't have the money on me. Can you wait here?
6192355001601506 You're out of your mind, Khatangher. Find yourself another fool.
6192355001601507 All right, have it your way. I'll buy it.
6192355001601505 Take him for two hundred. It's a good bull. Be khara, it'll be useful to you.
6192355001601513 What's so special about it?
6192355001601512 I'm leaving the Town, forever. Can't take him with me. It hurts me to sell him, but I don't have a choice. Buy my bull, kholboön!
6192355001601521 Guess it's not.
6192355001601522 That's all right. You'll find another buyer for your treasure.
6192355001601520 No, khayaala. I can't wait. Guess it's not in the cards then.
6192355001131784 Loy
6192355001029562 What's this?
6192355001038787 Huh. Unexpected.
6192355001029561 Here, have this item. This is for you.
6192355001038784 Well… Yes, I guess.
6192355001038785 I <i>am</i> its part.
6192355001038786 I know this game. We barter and share.
6192355001038783 A sign of trust.\nAs we share things with each other, so do we share our feelings. Warmth. Kindness. We see now that you're a good person. The Town trusts you. Do you want to become its part?
6192355001038789 What do you want in exchange?
6192355001038792 I don't really need anything.
6192355001038788 Do you like the item I've given you? Will you find any use for it? I don't really know what you need… I chose randomly. We don't know you very well yet.
6192355001038791 Others?
6192355001038797 I know this tradition…
6192355001672053 So if I barter at a loss, people would see me as a better person?
6192355001038790 It doesn't matter! All that matters is that there <i>was</i> an exchange. You give me something of yours and receive something of mine.\nAll items are charged with bits of your warmth and life… Give me whatever you want. To others, give what <i>they</i> want. They won't ask a lot. So if you share generously and give more than is asked, the Town will remember that.\nIt's just a token, after all. A tradition.
6192355001038794 And what happens?
6192355001038799 I'll look like an idiot. That's what will happen.
6192355001038800 Well, at least I'll know what each of you is interested in this September. That'll come in handy.
6192355001038793 Yes. Go and barter with different people. Not anyone in particular, just… different. Women and men, teenagers and little kids. You'll see what happens.
6192355001038796 Bayarlaa, basaghan. Please relay my gratitude to them.
6192355001038798 I won't do it. I don't need your love.
6192355001038795 You'll get to know us better. We'll get to know you better. Our town is like a family.\nYou have returned. Now, please help us remember, accept, and maybe even love you. I'm saying it on behalf of everyone.

6192355001043352 她怎么了？我们什么都没做，我发誓！我们看到她哭，问她发生了什么，但她只是哭得更厉害了。哎，女孩... 
6192355001047293 没错。
6192355001047294 嘘。你没必要把每个想法都大声说出来。
6192355001047292 但是她<i>挺好</i>。如果洗洗干净还是挺可爱的... 
6192355001047296 也许她迷路了？
6192355001047295 我猜。她一定是饿坏了。她哭这么厉害还能是什么原因？
6192355001047298 然后把她放到火车上驶向远方...
6192355001047301 我开玩笑的。不用管她，她会冷静下来的。
6192355001047297 我猜。她一定迷路了。也许我们应该把她带到火车站？ 
6192355001047300 好，你来做吧。
6192355001047302 你应该给她弄个土拨鼠，或者采一些花。
6192355001047299 火车现在不运行了。不过...我们应该看看她是不是住这附近。 
6192355001043351 
6192355001195658 梅
6192355001047252 Who's picking on you, dear?
6192355001047281 They're saying they didn't do anything to you. So what's going on?
6192355001047251 I'm not crying. I'm not. I'm just… upset. Upset, because they're always picking on me. All the time…
6192355001047283 Nonsense. You're very pretty.
6192355001047284 You're unlike anyone else. Trust me on that.
6192355001047285 Well, so it goes. Don't worry, you'll grow into your beauty. Maybe.
6192355001047282 They say I'm ugly. I know I am… But why do they need to keep saying it all the time?
6192355001047287 What do people say to you?
6192355001047286 Well… Those ones are okay, I guess. But even if they didn't say anything, I know they're thinking about it!
6192355001047289 How are they picking on you?
6192355001047288 Everyone.
6192355001195657 Vole
6192355001043377 Of course I'm scared. But I'm a brave man.
6192355001047253 Are you playing hide-and-seek?
6192355001047254 Oh, right, sorry. I am. Running away now.
6192355001043376 Why aren't you running away? Aren't you scared? Boo!
6192355001047256 What then?
6192355001047255 No, not that! Not hide-and-seek!
6192355001047258 How do you play that?
6192355001047257 Bone leg!
6192355001047260 But you have normal legs…
6192355001047261 Isn't it boring, just sitting here in one place?
6192355001047259 I have bone legs, see? I'm a clay wench! I cannot walk, but whoever sees me runs away in fear. You should run away too!
6192355001047263 How do you know so much about them?
6192355001047264 Want me to stand here in your place?
6192355001047262 I'm not bored. Clay wenches don't get bored!
6192355001047266 Okay, okay…
6192355001047267 You can't reach me.
6192355001047265 You're ruining it! Run away already! Ugh, I can't even stomp my foot… I'll bite you!
6192355001195656 "Wench"
6192355001044366 So?
6192355001047268 So now you want to stone him to death?
6192355001044365 What are you gawking at? Do you know who he is? He's Whitebeard之子! His dad went crazy yesterday and hurt people!
6192355001047270 I'd rather ask you.
6192355001047274 I'm not sure I want to.
6192355001047269 He's the same as his 父亲! Ask him! Ask him why his dad is called Whitebeard. Ask him!
6192355001047272 There's a bit too many of you, and only one of him, don't you think?
6192355001047273 Now calm down, everyone.
6192355001047271 He started it!
6192355001047276 A son does not answer for his 父亲's actions.
6192355001047279 Scram, will you? You little imps…
6192355001047275 That's 'cause he's a drunk! He gets smashed and attacks people! He raised a hand against my mom last year!
6192355001047278 Go get his 父亲 if you want. But leave the kid alone. I won't tell you twice!
6192355001047280 If he grows up to be like his 父亲, then meet here again in ten years. Same place, same people.
6192355001047277 Why do you get in our way? One way or the other, we'll get him.
6192355001044351 
6192355001195655 Barb
6192355001044372 I'll handle this.
6192355001044373 Even if he did, it wasn't <i>your</i> fault…
6192355001044371 My dad didn't hurt anyone yesterday! Tell them to get off me!
6192355001044370 
6192355001195654 Basya
6192355001065656 Don't they accept people from the Kin?
6192355001065657 They won't.
6192355001065655 They won't accept you either, khayaala?
6192355001065659 Be oylgono ougyb, why have you come? The Kin have never cooperated with the authorities.
6192355001065660 And so it will remain while you still think of yourselves as 奥吉姆斯基's slaves. It's not he who enslaved you. You enslaved yourselves.
6192355001065658 It's not because we're Khatanghe. But 萨普洛夫 thinks we're 牛老大 维拉德's people, and they have an arrangement. Be khara, they won't accept the 凯恩s' people either.
6192355001065662 This is not a real job, either… The patrols will be disbanded in a week.
6192355001065663 Aydahamne khүrene, the autumn will be rough.
6192355001065661 There's no work. The Factory is closed. Where should I go? How should I feed my children?
6192355001220051 Khatanger
6192355001551651 Khatangher
6192355001089252 Didn't I tell you not to come here?
6192355001089253 Who locked us here? Are your friends playing some kind of awful prank?
6192355001089251 So you're here, after all?
6192355001089255 Most likely.
6192355001089256 We'll see.
6192355001089254 We're dead now. Do you think we'll get sick?
6192355001134752 I… don't know. I guess we can try lighting candles, like in that urban legend of yours.
6192355001154572 Wait until dawn, I guess. It's not like we have tons of matches.
6192355001134751 So, what do we do?
6192355001154574 Like what?
6192355001154575 We need to find a way to open that door.
6192355001154573 Are you stupid? Our friends would never do that. Something strange really <i>is</i> happening…
6192355001154577 The place will become less gloomy in the light.
6192355001154578 I'll scout the house. Since we're here anyway…
6192355001154579 Stay here. If anything happens, scream, and I'll come for help.
6192355001154576 Are you for real?
6192355001131352 Indeed. Follow me.
6192355001131353 Well, you can stay if you wish.
6192355001131351 Time to get the hell away from here, right?
6192355001089267 诺克金
6192355001374246 
6192355001094252 In a way.
6192355001097797 You're mistaken, pal. I'm not a worker. I'm a doctor.
6192355001097798 Trying to reach 大 维拉德?
6192355001094251 Which department are you from, pal? Cutting?
6192355001097800 What happened?
6192355001097804 Brave words. Would you have the guts to repeat that to his face?
6192355001097799 That fat pig refuses to come out. Refuses even an explanation. Bloodsucker.
6192355001097802 What is this crowd?
6192355001097803 You're a talker. A taskmaster, I suppose?
6192355001097801 Good. We get a lot of workplace accidents. We need a doctor. At least if he's like old 布拉克, God rest his soul: Turning his nose at nothing and not trying to swindle three days' payment out of you for a single examination.
6192355001097806 So what happened this time?
6192355001097805 Enough! We've been silent for too many years, and where did it get us? To the brink of starvation. Our patience runs thin!
6192355001097808 Yeah…
6192355001097819 But he's the one creating that work in the first place. Isn't he?
6192355001097807 The Factory shut down two days ago, didn't you know? I mean, yeah, there is this soot problem…\nBut when will it run again? How many of us will find themselves on the streets? Will anyone pay us for the downtime, or will the payment be reduced? I can tell you right now it's the latter! And that won't feed my children!
6192355001097810 Perhaps.
6192355001097811 Closing the Bull Enterprise? I don't think so. We produce so much meat… Everyone needs to eat.
6192355001097824 There have been, indeed, many suspicious coincidences.
6192355001097809 We want <i>at least</i> to be told what's going on! Why is the train not coming? Why did he cork up the Termitary? I'll tell you why! They want it all shut down! They're just looking for an excuse to close the Factory!\nThere was no accident, and the toxic soot is a lie, a cover, a crock of shit!
6192355001097813 It'll be fine.
6192355001097814 Nothing ever ends well.
6192355001097812 Were you born yesterday, pal? What do you know? People are illiterate here, no fancy schools, but they still think faster than you. The state has one leg in the grave. Things are going downhill so quickly, we can't even end this bloody war.\nIt won't end well…
6192355001097818 All right. I'll tell him.
6192355001097822 You go ahead and stay here. Perhaps it will bear fruit.
6192355001097823 Actually, I agree that it doesn't look well. Too many strange things happening. And they all align…
6192355001097817 Are you going to see the man yourself? Tell him we ain't leaving without an answer. More people will come. We'll stay here for as long as we have to.\nLet the hateful pig tell us the truth.
6192355001097821 And 你想要什么？
6192355001097820 Work… It's serfdom, not work! We're not cattle, we're people! And we deserve to be treated as such!
6192355001113051 Worker
6192355001094256 I've recently arrived from the outside. Trains still work.
6192355001095153 It's not like we're on an island in the middle of the ocean.
6192355001094255 It's all because of the damned war. We are losing it. The train that came in June was the last, I just know it. We're not seeing another one.
6192355001095152 We'll survive, just like everyone else does.
6192355001095157 A train with goods will come eventually.
6192355001097753 We have cows and we have bulls, not to mention stores of meat in the Warehouses.
6192355001095151 We've been cut off from the world, all alone. Food supplies are dwindling. I'm not even talking about medicine—where are we to get more? \nAnd now our only competent doctor is gone. This winter will be the end of our town.
6192355001095155 Oh, come on…
6192355001095156 Perhaps.
6192355001095154 That's exactly how it is.
6192355001097752 That's true.
6192355001097756 There's always room for change. Let the child crawl, and after a couple of head bumps it will be running around.
6192355001097757 When threatened, people tend to get their shit together. Maybe towns are like that too.
6192355001097751 I hope you're right… But the coming winter will be harsh, mark my words. \nIn times like these, it becomes apparent just how childish we are. So dependent on that umbilical cord, on the noble families. Without them, we're done for. Our town can't stand on its own… It can feed others, but can't support itself.
6192355001195666 Busybody
6192355001374456 
6192355001374457 
6192355001094265 为什么？
6192355001106016 Don't worry, pal. Crows have the right to be devout too.
6192355001094264 The crows perching directly on the Cathedral are a bad omen.
6192355001106018 Makes time for what?
6192355001106019 Do the 凯恩s mean it for real?
6192355001106020 Yeah, I've heard.
6192355001106017 For the 凯恩s, every building is a machine, making something for humans… or with them. For example, this Cathedral has nothing to do with religion. There is a grim joke circulating around, claiming that the Cathedral makes time.
6192355001106022 All right. But how are crows at fault?
6192355001106023 Funny.
6192355001106021 Just <i>makes it.</i> Produces it.\nThe 凯恩s lay out their buildings in such a way that they change the perception and worldview of those inside them.\nI guess 西蒙 wanted people feel the flow of time differently inside the Cathedral, so that's how he planned the building… But then rumors simplified the idea.
6192355001106025 I, on the other hand, don't like being rushed.
6192355001106026 It's not just the 凯恩s. I like it when time itself hurries me up.
6192355001106024 They slow time down. The 凯恩s rush it ahead, they refuse to sit on their hands. Complacency and laziness are the worst sins in their book. Slow time is tantamount to death for them…\nBut those are just silly rumors.
6192355001118151 
6192355001191451 Nerve
6192355001094269 Numerous indeed. A beautiful sight, huh?
6192355001106034 How fares your kine, khayaala. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355001106035 With us, Khatanghe, all omens seem to be death omens. And no one cares! I don't think I've ever met a people so indifferent.
6192355001094268 The crows being so numerous this year are a bad omen. Sayn baina, khayaala. How fares your kine?
6192355001106037 为什么？
6192355001106036 Beautiful indeed! Yamar goe bee! Still, as an omen, it's bad.
6192355001106039 Tenegh! Bite your tongue! You don't know what you're saying.
6192355001106040 Evils always passed us by, and so it will now. Bayartay, khayaala.
6192355001106041 Let them wait. They'll get nothing.
6192355001106038 When crows are numerous, they're waiting for carrion. And what can we give them? Our bodies feed Mother Boddho, the Earth. Why feed crows? Aydahamne khүrene, that would be like giving yourself to the sky. \nYou know it's a bad way to go. And so the omen is ill.
6192355001191452 Blood
6192355001094267 What kind of omen is that?
6192355001106027 I don't notice them either. Even the cawing has become a background noise, like a sea splashing.
6192355001094266 The crows not being noticed by anyone is a bad omen.
6192355001106029 The four of us.
6192355001106033 That's ominous.
6192355001106028 A real one. Crows are harbingers of death. Whoever doesn't notice crows, will die soon.\nWe've been standing here for a while. Many many many people passed us by… The three of us were the only ones who stopped to look.
6192355001106031 Seems like you're behind on your arithmetic. Study better.
6192355001106032 Whichever you prefer. Three is fine by me.
6192355001106030 The three. There are three of us. Oh… Yes. Four.
6192355001191453 Skin
6192355001095253 I may what?
6192355001109564 Thanks, sister.
6192355001095252 The Judge is in his workshop, around the corner. But I can tell you his answer right now: "Yes, you may."
6192355001095256 And why have you come?
6192355001109565 The Judge sure puts a lot of trust in the townsfolk.
6192355001095255 You may slay the outlaws at night without repercussions. You're the fifth to come and ask about that.
6192355001095258 I admire your resolve.
6192355001109570 Enough chitchat. To the left, around the corner?
6192355001095257 I'm wondering if my man is going to come and ask the same. If he's genuinely planning to kill the killers. If he is, I'm leaving. Today.
6192355001109567 Be careful at night. There's no guarantee your boyfriend doesn't join the outlaws instead.
6192355001109568 He's probably just trying to protect you.
6192355001109569 Thanks a lot. Now I'm feeling ashamed of myself.
6192355001109566 If somebody you know is planning to murder a person, even a villain… then there's something wrong with them. And I've seen a few red flags already…
6192355001095251 Agnia
6192355001104553 "Our place"? Did I hear you right?
6192355001104554 Just who the hell do you think you are?
6192355001104555 No rest for the wicked, huh?
6192355001104552 So, I cleaned our place up. I burned the trash, took away the bones—I mean, the cracked ones, and I put that weird grey goo from the table in a bucket. Might be useful, right?
6192355001104557 You whippersnapper… What am I supposed to do with you?
6192355001104558 Don't you dare.
6192355001104559 No money for you. I'll go home and make everything myself.
6192355001104556 I can also whip up something for us to eat. Got any money?
6192355001104561 No. No no no. No "together." Didn't I tell you not to touch anything?
6192355001104562 Why do you care anyway?
6192355001104560 Anyway, when are you coming back? Should I wait for you or what? Someone's gotta take care of your dad's stuff, and… stuff. I think it would be great if we did it together.
6192355001104564 No trading anything!
6192355001104565 No fixing anything!
6192355001104566 Just… just stay here and don't go anywhere. Don't even move. Got it?
6192355001104563 By the way, I, uh… broke a pipe over there. I don't think it was important though. So don't hit me, all right? I'll fix it myself.\nBoar has a pipe like that. I bet he'll trade it for a bottle of alcohol. We have a couple of those, right?
6192355001104568 Good, kiddo. Great. Keep it up.
6192355001104567 Got it.
6192355001106043 Did you live there?
6192355001106046 Yeah. You have to leave.
6192355001107358 你是谁？
6192355001106042 They, uh… I believe they already gave you the key to the lair where the Old Man had worked. Does it… does it mean I have to leave? Can I stay, maybe?
6192355001106045 Right.
6192355001106044 No… It's my workplace.
6192355001106048 Some worker you are…
6192355001107364 你是谁 calling old?
6192355001106047 …Old man, can I stay? I want to be a doctor. I'll help you! I'll work!
6192355001107352 I have a sugar intolerance. But I'll think about it.
6192355001107353 Fine, we'll manage together… I can't just throw you out, can I?
6192355001107354 No. I don't need one more burden. I have enough responsibilities as it is.
6192355001107351 Can I please stay? Pretty please with sugar on top!
6192355001107356 An orphan? I see. So here we are now, two orphans.
6192355001107357 No means no.
6192355001107355 Me? A burden? You're a burden! I've never been one! I've known how to get around since I was a tiny kid! I'm an orphan, got it?
6192355001107360 Why don't you live home?
6192355001107359 They call me 史迪奇. I've no idea why.
6192355001107362 So you stayed at my 父亲's workshop?
6192355001107363 You know what? Go to the Shelter. It's a house by the river in the Flank. 劳拉 拉薇尔 lives there, she'll take you in.
6192355001107361 I don't have a home. I'm an orphan.
6192355001104551 史迪奇
6192355001120654 How rude.
6192355001120655 你是谁？
6192355001120656 What are you doing here?
6192355001120653 Out. Now.
6192355001120658 No, I hear you loud and clear.
6192355001120659 Just wondering how you survived this long with manners like those.
6192355001120657 One more word from you and everything will break. I told you to get lost. Are you stupid?
6192355001120661 Mind your manners, girl.
6192355001120662 Who knows…
6192355001120660 Dividing power. You're not required.
6192355001120663 玛利亚·凯恩娜
6192355001121052 Just say it out loud: They're thieves.
6192355001121053 你是谁？
6192355001121051 Even in a handcrafted town like this, there is an underground, a rat's nest. At odds with the law. At odds with good morals. People come to them with dubious challenges and requests.
6192355001121055 格里夫's?
6192355001121056 I always knew 坏格里夫's conscience was somewhere around… Yet still separate from the guy himself.
6192355001121054 A Reflection. Call me his conscience, if you will.
6192355001121058 Yet he <i>has</i> changed.
6192355001121059 And here I thought…
6192355001121057 You know my master. He is your friend, and he hasn't changed much since you last saw him. He always loved to live on the edge. Never was a stickler for rules.\nBut he was never truly vile or cruel.
6192355001121061 …Playing pretend? Don't make me laugh.
6192355001121062 Thieves and rats never tolerate false leaders. Are you telling me they're all just playing war here?
6192355001121060 He wants to seem a kingpin, a king; a local tzar of his own small turf. Wants to <i>seem,</i> not <i>be.</i> Play a big wheeler-dealer.\nBut that's not who he really is. He's just…
6192355001121064 Isn't it?
6192355001121065 How do you know he even has a conscience?
6192355001121063 He's worried that blood started to spill now. And it was probably spilled by his men. The people who rubbed shoulders with him, hiding their teeth at first…\nHe's worried you'll think he has it all under control, meaning today's craze is his doing.
6192355001121067 Yeah, right…
6192355001121068 Dreams live in the Upper Town, not here. Closer to the Bridge Square…
6192355001121066 Such is our town. You know it yourself: It's a very good village. Beautiful people live here, infusing it with a very spiritual dream. There's no real, villainous crime here. Even the rats and the thieves are softer.
6192355001121070 Touching.
6192355001121069 I am his Reflection. Who else is to know what his heart is worried about?
6192355001121072 Thanks, Reflection. That's comforting to know.
6192355001121073 So the fellow bit off more than he can chew. We'll see where it leads.
6192355001121071 Perhaps he is partially responsible. Perhaps he did corrupt them with his talk of how any law is but chains that one must break in order to become free and truly human…\nBut he never wanted bloodshed. Keep that in mind.
6192355001121075 Well, 为什么？
6192355001121076 His soul has very good reasons to tremble. Don't bother going into detail.
6192355001121074 Would you like to know what your old friend is truly worried about now? He's playing a dashing scoundrel in front of you, but his soul is trembling.
6192355001131851 Grigory's Reflection
6192355001131852 Mishka
6192355001134075 It was a theatre of tragedy.
6192355001638951 So... I'll have to work right here? On the stage?
6192355001134074 What once was a theatre of comedy is now an anatomy theatre. 
6192355001134754 So you're an orderly?
6192355001134762 Your work is worse.
6192355001134763 Nothing is worse than hospitals, not to mention theatres.
6192355001134753 Each day will bring new jobs. For you and for us.\nYou work here in the hospital; we crawl around houses looking for corpses. God knows which is worse…
6192355001134756 Looks gorgeous.
6192355001134757 Do these costumes really offer protection?
6192355001134758 Doesn't your work require… hands?
6192355001134755 So I am. At least while I'm wearing these rags. Such are our orders.
6192355001134760 Every day? Sounds good.
6192355001134761 God, the smell here…
6192355001134764 They're not doomed yet.
6192355001134759 I guess. \nI don't envy you, working with the doomed and dead. But you will have <i>some</i> support.\nThere, deep on the stage, to the left of you—is a closet, see? You'll find medicine inside. Replenished every day. You're free to grab and use it.
6192355001638953 All right. What do I need to know?
6192355001638952 Same as everyone, sir. Same as everyone.
6192355001134073 Orderly
6192355001141173 …You really can talk?
6192355001452767 You really can talk.
6192355001452768 Has 格蕾丝 given me the power to hear you, somehow?
6192355001141172 COLD\nICY—COLD\nI—SEE—COLD\nALL CALLED\nALL
6192355001452770 …Is 伊西多·布拉克 among you?
6192355001452771 I see. You are definitely cramped.
6192355001452772 Cold can be driven away… by fire.
6192355001452769 ALL—CALL—ALL—COLD\nICY—I—SEE—I\nLACKING\nCLAD—IN—COLD
6192355001452774 I'm sorry I asked.
6192355001452775 None of you are alone over there… You're all pretty cramped.
6192355001452776 You need warmth.
6192355001452773 CALL—ONE—CALL—ALL\nALL—ONE\nALONE
6192355001249951 Cold Ones
6192355001147252 Likewise. I was wondering about 格蕾丝. Have you found her a new home?
6192355001147251 Glad to see you in good health.
6192355001408152 You've been banished to a corner, I see.
6192355001408156 I can.
6192355001408151 …Worst of all, the smell. Can you smell it? Gunpowder…
6192355001408158 "They," who?
6192355001408159 Where did you send 格蕾丝, the cemetery girl?
6192355001408157 I'm fine with the corner. This corner of the world, anyway. What's so bad about it? Corners are cozy. And I don't need much.\nAt least they still let us work… somewhat.
6192355001408161 Yes. Where is she?
6192355001408160 They who smell of powder.\nI remember you, by the way. You were worried about 格蕾丝, right? The cemetery girl?
6192355001408163 …Unthinkable, to put it mildly! He's a drunk and… who knows what else! Definitely not the nurturing type.
6192355001408164 Yeah… a bit.
6192355001515951 …How could she become a dead man's ward?
6192355001501190 No. Nothing surprises me anymore.
6192355001408162 She's now 彼得·斯塔马丁's ward.\nDon't give me that look. Does it seem so unthinkable? So surprising?
6192355001501192 Huh. You're the last person I expected to talk to me about connections.
6192355001501193 More philosophy.
6192355001501194 Sure. For adults. Not young girls…
6192355001501191 Don't judge a book by its cover. Sometimes, people form unexpected connections!\nImagine—two people living in completely different worlds. Different habits, educations, and hobbies. But when they meet, their souls resonate! Connections like that make the world more… vibrant.
6192355001515953 Twins or not, they're hard to mistake for one another.
6192355001515954 It's not that important. What matters is if the girl's looked after.
6192355001579965 Well, the twin is dead, too.
6192355001515952 …A dead man? But—but he came in person…\nOh. I see. It must have been Peter's brother. They're twins…
6192355001515956 Nothing offers good protection from plague.
6192355001515957 You're right. We needed to minimize her contact with corpses. That was… potentially dangerous.
6192355001515958 You're all insane…
6192355001515955 In any case, 格蕾丝 lives at 彼得·斯塔马丁's place now. It's a tall, sturdy building with thick walls and snug window-frames. It offers good protection from plague and bad weather. That's what matters.
6192355001579967 Stellar job, Dora. Brilliantly done.
6192355001579966 …A double?
6192355001147254 I… what? No!
6192355001177251 I've got an entire litter.
6192355001147253 Are you with a child?
6192355001177254 You thought <i>I</i> brought in a baby?
6192355001177255 You thought I <i>brought in</i> a baby?
6192355001177256 You thought I brought in <i>a baby?</i>
6192355001177253 Apologies. I thought you brought in a baby.
6192355001177258 If I have to.
6192355001177259 Normal, abandoned, infected… You name it.
6192355001177257 Do you visit infected houses during your work?
6192355001177261 As if a baby stands a chance against sand pest.
6192355001180761 Who cares about rewards…
6192355001180762 Got it. If I ever find one, I'll bring it here.
6192355001177260 The Mistress decreed: Everyone who rescues an infant from an infected house is to bring it here. Such a dangerous feat won't go unrewarded.
6192355001180758 Well I'll be damned…
6192355001180759 The other teenagers end up dead.
6192355001180760 You should inform 丹考夫斯基 about this. If babies really possess the greatest resistance… he should be able to use that, somehow.
6192355001180757 There is a chance! They discussed it earlier today: Adults are more susceptible to the disease! Babies can hold out the longest. Kids, too. Even teenagers, and those imps poke around everywhere. Most emerge none the worse for it! 
6192355001174661 It wasn't me who found him, it was that circus performer. I'm just making the delivery.
6192355001149056 I'm not sure, I'm not a pediatrician. It seems quiet and content though.
6192355001149055 …You're a hero, you know that? How did you find it? Is it healthy?
6192355001180766 It was her. She's braver than she looks.
6192355001180764 I know. I got suspicious, so I intervened and brought the baby straight to you.
6192355001180765 Maybe she desperately needs money. That, or she's desperately trying to get into everyone's good 格蕾丝s.
6192355001180763 安娜 Angel? Going outside, today of all days? That seems unlikely. She has a fit every time people mention dirt around her. It must've been someone else.
6192355001251553 I think it's better to leave her alone for now.
6192355001449353 Same as usual, I think…
6192355001251552 Have you spoken to the girl? How is she?
6192355001594772 Are you sure that's a good idea?
6192355001594773 Glad to hear it.
6192355001251554 I came to take her away. The 城镇大厅 is finally ready to find her a normal place to live.
6192355001449355 Yes. It's the right thing to do.
6192355001449356 Still, no.
6192355001449354 So I'm taking her?
6192355001594775 格蕾丝 is an unusual girl. She has different needs than other kids.
6192355001594776 She's a neurotic kid. Moving her to a different place could traumatize her.
6192355001594777 The townsfolk respect her. If 格蕾丝 were removed from the cemetery, chaos could ensue. And that's the last thing we want now.
6192355001594778 She belongs here.
6192355001594779 I always have doubt…
6192355001594774 Of course. Is there any doubt?
6192355001594781 It's 格蕾丝…
6192355001594782 What is it?
6192355001594780 Oh, come to your senses, Doctor 布拉克! Do you even know the girl's name?
6192355001594784 Why call her a "weed"? Precious herbs grow in the cemetery, too.
6192355001594785 There are lots of orphans and urchins in our Town. What's one more?
6192355001594786 But what if she likes it this way?
6192355001594787 You're right… I don't know what got into me.
6192355001594783 "格蕾丝" is just a nickname. She's nameless. She has no documents… Her 父亲 and mother were twyrine drunks, they never bothered.\nShe can't read or write. Eats whatever she picks off the ground. She's living like a weed!
6192355001594789 You're right.
6192355001594792 There's nothing wrong with soil. Leave 格蕾丝 alone.
6192355001594788 What will become of her when she grows up? Or—oh, this is simpler—in winter, when it drops below <i>zero?</i>\nHere, the only path ahead of her is one that leads right down into graveyard soil.
6192355001168451 
6192355001171251 Dora
6192355001151734 Who?
6192355001151735 Yes, a legion of microbes. If we don't get infected, consider us born once again tonight...
6192355001151736 Well, I guess someone lives here. Or used to.
6192355001151733 Huh, so you came here too? That's lucky. Something does feel off. I think there's someone else here beside us.
6192355001151738 Come now… Perhaps some drifter just got in.
6192355001151739 Stay here. I'll come back to you after I check.
6192355001151740 There's no one here but us.
6192355001151737 Perhaps it <i>is</i> Death himself. I never would have said this before, but… everything happens.
6192355001157552 可汗
6192355001161452 This is a sanitary inspection.
6192355001185169 I have no intention of buying anything. Just wanted to meet you.
6192355001185170 But <i>I</i> can help <i>you.</i> You've got a rash all over your face, red eyes… Those are the signs.
6192355001161451 Ah, our new doctor… but this ain't a drugstore. I can't help you.
6192355001161457 I've just been to them.
6192355001185194 There an outbreak in the Town. For now, it's only touched the poorer districts, but who knows…
6192355001161453 Everything is clean here. No rats. And there's been no orders to close the shop. Or else I demand a warrant from the 凯恩s.
6192355001161459 No. First, you will answer a question for me.
6192355001185198 What's that behind your back?
6192355001161458 Stop it with the nonsense, good sir. If you're here to buy, here's the counter. And if you're only interested in rambling, the door is over there. We're closed.
6192355001185172 Well, having a doctor as a friend might come in handy these days. Doctors and merchants are anyone's most useful contacts.
6192355001185193 Perhaps there is a reason. There's an outbreak in town, haven't you heard?
6192355001185171 为什么？ I don't give out goods on trust anymore, not in times like these. I know who you are: a doctor. You know who I am: a merchant. There's no reason for us to pretend we're friends.
6192355001185174 Now is not a time for jokes. Do you think I would just drop by at random?
6192355001185224 We doctors have a very particular brand of humor. It's different.
6192355001185225 Yeah, it is… Relax.
6192355001185173 Is that some kind of joke?
6192355001185176 I'm afraid so.
6192355001185181 I suspect it might be. We'll need to check.
6192355001185185 Calm down. If it were the sand pest, you'd be convulsing on the floor already. It's different.
6192355001185175 So what, will I be quarantined now? Is this… <i>the thing?</i>\n…Come on, talk, you bastard! Is it?
6192355001185178 Calm down. It was just a joke.
6192355001185206 Sounds about right. You're not the most honest person in town, are you?
6192355001185177 Then this is it. I'm done. Go, doctor. I need to think of my soul now.
6192355001185180 Come on... that was uncalled for.
6192355001185204 I'll take a look at your wares.
6192355001185205 Damn it... I hope the kid was quick.
6192355001185179 Oh, so this is your idea of of a joke? I love jokes. I'm a funny guy too. I think I'll charge you extra from now on. As a kind of humor tax, you know? So think twice before you make another joke—or it will all <i>cost</i> you twice.\nNow buy what you came to buy or get lost.
6192355001185183 Slow down. No need to jump to conclusions. In our line of work, miracles happen.
6192355001185184 You got me. I was just kidding… Ha ha. The look on your face!
6192355001185188 I did.
6192355001185182 What's there to check? It's lethal. Everyone knows it. But… did you mean it?
6192355001185190 You know, I remember this story… One time, a person inhaled a pine tree cone. Can you guess what happened?
6192355001185209 Forget it. Let's get down to business. Do you buy… ahem… derelict goods?
6192355001185189 What do you mean?
6192355001185192 So here's a coin. Heads or tails? Choose.
6192355001185223 Where do you get your goods?
6192355001185191 Well? What is it?
6192355001185196 So you might be a dead man walking already, pal.
6192355001185197 Come now… No one is accusing you.
6192355001185203 Why so rude? Expecting someone? Eager to turn away a potential witness, maybe? I've heard you're not just a seller, but a buyer, too…
6192355001185195 An outbreak? So what? Am I selling rotten meat? No. Find yourself a food store to harass!
6192355001185200 Well… This didn't work out.
6192355001185201 Hey, let's trade, at least.
6192355001185202 And to you! See you around.
6192355001185199 Is this your idea of fun, sawbones? I won't be the butt of your jokes. I might not have studied in a big city, but I have my dignity. Good day.
6192355001185208 A month passes.
6192355001185228 No. No, he wasn't well. It killed him. What did you expect?
6192355001185207 Well?
6192355001185211 Everything.
6192355001185212 Just choose.
6192355001185215 Your life.
6192355001185210 What's at stake?
6192355001185214 I can't choose for you. That would be dishonest.
6192355001185216 Choose.
6192355001185213 I need to know what the stakes are.
6192355001185218 You have.
6192355001185219 The stake is your life. Always has been. You just never noticed.
6192355001185220 Well?
6192355001185217 But I haven't bet anything.
6192355001185222 I'm afraid you lose.
6192355001185226 Lucky you. You don't even know how lucky…
6192355001185227 Keep this coin. Dark times are coming. It'll come in handy.
6192355001185221 Well… Tails, I guess.
6192355001185230 And they find a tumor in his chest. Cancer. Growths all over.
6192355001185229 And?
6192355001185232 So I dissect him. And you know what I find in his chest?
6192355001185233 No need to rush. This is just a preamble…
6192355001185231 Come on, speak up!
6192355001185235 A pine tree branch! Lungs are rich with oxygen, so it sprouted. So yeah, things happen…
6192355001185236 Then I won't tell you how it ends. Stay ignorant.
6192355001185237 I'm not so rich as to pay for someone's patience. See you, good man.
6192355001185234 If I knew, I'd make you pay for every minute of my patience. Which has, by the way, run out.

6192355001183652 I can tell you what ho doesn't do: sleep. As far as I can tell.
6192355001183653 I barely know him.
6192355001183654 "False"? He was a very loyal student. Went overboard, even.
6192355001183651 That 斯塔克·鲁宾, akhar. Your 父亲's false student. You know him. Tell me what he does at night.
6192355001183656 Why do you care?
6192355001183657 Ask him yourself. During the day, he's in the hospital, working.
6192355001183658 Good question…
6192355001183655 Tell me, what does he do during the night? Where does he hide?
6192355001183660 Precisely. Outsiders have no obligation to honor our traditions.
6192355001183661 For what it's worth, I'm an outsider too.
6192355001183659 He has no respect for the dead. No respect for the body. He cuts bodies open without 格蕾丝. He knows not the Lines.\nHe's an outsider.
6192355001183663 Unente… Don't tell me. I know.
6192355001183664 I think… Actually, disregard that. I don't think anything.
6192355001183665 I'll take care of him. He's my friend, after all. Not yours.
6192355001183662 The Khatanghe are worried. Your friend is doing evil. The blame, as always, will be pinned to us. And we are dwindling by the hour as it is. Mere hundreds left now.
6192355001183667 为什么？
6192355001183668 You're right. Otherwise he might die from exhaustion.
6192355001183669 I'm curious now. What <i>does</i> he do at night…?
6192355001183666 He won't say. And we don't have time. He needs to be stopped. Fast. Very fast.

6192355001192254 They don't ever get sick? You're sure?
6192355001192255 Bayarlaa, people. I'll take as much as I need myself.
6192355001192253 The booha grants you his blood. Take the blood.\nThe booha are immune to Earth plague. The disease rolls off them. Water off fowl. The blood is strong. Drink it, yargachin. It's good for your health.
6192355001192257 No, he's no fool… Perhaps I should tell him of this bull thing.
6192355001192258 So there's something special about their blood. Sure, why not.
6192355001192259 That's fine, pal. I'll take the bull's gift. Bayarlaa.
6192355001192256 We keep eyes on every bull. We love them. Know them better than our children. If a bull died, how could we have missed it?\nA learned man came to us. He said, "The bulls brought the disease." He was a fool. He made a mistake.
6192355001200377 When was the last time a bull died on its own?
6192355001200376 No you won't, yargachin. We are numerous, and all of us need to partake of his blood.\nEvery bucket will nourish many Kindred souls. We are grateful for your craft, and so your share is bigger than any of ours already.
6192355001192261 What are you celebrating, children of mine?
6192355001192262 What order? What rank?
6192355001192263 Is the girl comfortable up there? Are you sure she won't catch a cold?
6192355001192260 You found us, yargachin. We are happy to have you here. We looked for a butcher, a butcher to help us restore order. To complete the rank.
6192355001192265 You're talking about the bull, I hope.
6192355001192266 A perfect body… A chimera. I get it. The girl fused with the bull, and must be separated. Right?
6192355001192267 So, a rite. I thought such traditions were long forgotten. Did you revive it because of the plague?
6192355001192264 Behold this perfect body. It must be properly divided.
6192355001192269 Is this your attempt to end the plague?
6192355001192268 You're a funny man, yargachin. I'm glad to hear your jokes. We also joke, sometimes. Among the Kin. Yes. Jokes…
6192355001192271 Fine. I know the Lines. I'll cut the bull.
6192355001192272 No. I won't be pleased at all. Find another butcher.
6192355001192270 The outbreak is only one misfortune. We do this for other reasons. \nThe bull is like the world. A yargachin cuts the bull along the Lines, and the world comes to order. The bull is pleased. We are pleased. You are pleased.
6192355001192274 Really? That changes things.
6192355001192275 When I need blood, I'll take a sample from any bull. No killing required.
6192355001192273 We can grant blood. All you want. The booha's blood, free of Earth disease. Never sick.
6192355001192277 You do that. I'll come soon.
6192355001192278 I'll think about it.
6192355001192276 Look. He says farewell to the Town. The Town says farewell. While he walks the streets, the Town grows into him, binds him with love. When it is done, he will return to the place of blood, the Ragi Barrow.\nWe will wait for the butcher there.
6192355001200373 Let's go.
6192355001200374 I'll think about it.
6192355001200372 He said farewell to the Town. The Town touched him and bound him with the string of love. The time for farewells is over. It is time to leave for the Ragi Barrow, the place of blood.\nGood thing you've come, yargachin. You know the Lines, you can complete the rite.
6192355001194952 That's a good blade.
6192355001200375 No need. I'd rather use my own.
6192355001194951 He is ready, yargachin, he only waits for you, yargachin. Much joy in such waiting. Soon he will become himself, and the sky and earth will return to their due places. Gorkhon shall flow, and harsh winter will chase away the foul autumn. That which came from the ground shall return to the ground.\nA blade for you, yargachin. To trace his Lines properly.

6192355001193256 You should be wondering who I saw.
6192355001195252 I've done nothing yet. But I'm about to.
6192355001203877 You have unburied people there.
6192355001193255 你是谁？ An orderly? What were you doing in there?
6192355001193258 I did.
6192355001203869 And don't you dare erase it… or mark other houses.
6192355001193257 What is that white cross on the door? Did you mark our house?
6192355001203868 It means, "woe is this house."
6192355001203870 Do you live here?
6192355001203867 What does it mean?
6192355001203872 Did you commission someone to… preserve your dead?
6192355001203876 The 凯恩s' people will come here soon. Stay elsewhere until they're done.
6192355001203871 Yes.
6192355001203874 Well, now they will. But they wouldn't have if you'd just buried your dead properly.
6192355001203875 Don't worry, no one will harm you. Just bury your dead.
6192355001203873 We were scared they'd lock us all in if they found out…
6192355001203879 Promise?
6192355001203880 I can't. It needs to be stopped, or else the whole district might get infected.
6192355001203878 Leave us be, I beg of you… Don't tell anyone. We'll… we'll bury them all later. Tonight. At the cemetery. Just don't tell on us…
6192355001203882 Save your money. Just do as you promised.
6192355001203883 Calm down. No one will lock you in. And don't you dare erase the cross I'm about to draw.
6192355001203881 I promise. I promise! Just don't tell them… They'll lock us all in… They'll sandbox us. Certain death. I'd give you money, but we have nothing left!

6192355001193262 How fares your kine, abgay.
6192355001200362 Sayn bayna, ekhene.
6192355001193261 How fares you kine, Khatangher?
6192355001200364 Do you think it will help?
6192355001200365 Why bring one from the Steppe? Don't we have enough of our own?
6192355001200371 I know.
6192355001200363 Things are looking up. A beautiful bull is coming from the Steppe to walk the streets soon. Here, in the Earth, to chase away the pest. To restore things to how they were.
6192355001200367 Do you believe in the old rites?
6192355001200366 That bull is clean, closer to Mother Boddho, to the Earth herself. All of ours are too close to the Olonngo. They expect death-Suok to grab them by the horns any day.
6192355001200369 You're right about trying.
6192355001200370 May only good changes come visit you, abgay.
6192355001200368 Not sure. The elders believe, and the young ones don't. \nTrying won't hurt, I think. There are ten reasons behind every change, but only one of them matters. How does one find it?

6192355001257851 Unfortunately, some diseases don't.
6192355001257852 But it's not cholera we're dealing with.
6192355001246451 Forget it, it's broken. Broken… They've destroyed water pumps all over the Town, the villains!\nThe Gorkhon water's foul, sure, but we don't drink it! What about washing, cleaning? It's fine when boiled. Cholera dies in boiled water.
6192355001257854 What tagloor?
6192355001257855 Huh.
6192355001257853 Hell if I know! People have turned to wolves now, packs of wolves. Some destroy water pumps, others look for the carrier; some stock up on kerosene, planning to burn houses… Everyone has their own truth.\nI also heard of a suicidal tagloor. They don't wait for death… too scared.
6192355001257859 Wrong. A "tagloor" are a group of people who share a common fate.
6192355001257860 I know what a tagloor is. What you describe is psychosis.
6192355001257861 Well, if you don't know the details, stop spreading rumors. And drink from the Gullet or the Guzzle. The water is better there.
6192355001257858 Well, it's like a community… a steppe word. I don't know the details.

6192355001456153 Was it rough?
6192355001252355 Her questions are madness!\n<i>What</i> numbers? My work schedule… Who I'd like to be rid of… I'm an ordinary person—why ask me? I live a good life, I'm a productive member of the community, I've never hurt anyone…
6192355001456152 I guess she hasn't broken you completely yet.
6192355001456154 Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
6192355001456151 She's like a magician… Asked four questions, wrote down three letters. I have no idea what it meant, but I'm scared.
6192355001252358 You're only realizing it now?
6192355001456155 There aren't many good or bad people in the world. Most people are just people.
6192355001252357 Ugh. I guess I was lucky this time. I'm a good person! A good person…
6192355001507911 Huh…
6192355001507909 Sounds like she got you turned around.
6192355001507910 Drink some water. Do you have any on you?
6192355001507908 I need to sit down… I'm dizzy.
6192355001507913 Wow. Wonder how I'll see myself after the interrogation.
6192355001507914 Hush. Calm down now.
6192355001507912 I can see now that I've always had that in me. I see myself with different eyes…
6192355001252360 What did you discuss?
6192355001456164 Did she summon your children, too?
6192355001252359 But I've got kids… kids! These hands work to feed them both. I teach them to be good.
6192355001456163 Don't.
6192355001456165 What <i>does</i> she do to you all…
6192355001456161 How did she find out about the theft? Ugh… It wasn't even a <i>real</i> theft! And I'll never do it again!

6192355001578351 Bite kharaan, you want to take our Mother? You cannot have her. We won't let you. She won't let you.
6192355001578355 Maybe.
6192355001578356 No. But I want to help you.
6192355001578354 Would you lead us, then? Rule us wisely, by the Lines? Hear the bellowing of Mother Boddho? Protect us from harm, eradication?
6192355001578358 You need no rulers.
6192355001578359 Shudkher! Do you really see yourselves as a herd in need of a shepherd?
6192355001578357 你是谁 to give us orders? You're not our ruler.
6192355001578361 I'm trying to become whatever 父亲 was!
6192355001578362 You're not children! And you don't need a ruler.
6192355001578360 We need parents, aba ezhe. We are a family, a Khatanghe. Your 父亲's dead. 泰吉's dead. You refuse to take your 父亲's burden.\nYet we have our Mother. We won't give her up.
6192355001578364 So that's what you meant…
6192355001578365 While the mare carries a rider, it will turn wherever he pleases. Is that what you mean?
6192355001578366 Baygalday. I won't have it.
6192355001578363 We are the Khatanghe, the Kin. We obey strength. As long as Fat 维拉德 rules over us, we belong to him. When he dies, we'll listen to another. To you.
6192355001578368 How?
6192355001578367 Then help us break free.
6192355001578370 为什么？
6192355001578369 We cannot obey you, emshen. Even if we wanted to.
6192355001578372 I'm not a stranger.
6192355001578373 Be khara, my own people are destroying themselves… You deserve it!
6192355001578371 Did you not hear what our Mother said? A head cannot be taken from its body. She can't leave this place without us. We won't let her go to certain death with a stranger. A body is whole.
6192355001578375 What proof do you need?
6192355001578376 I am part of you.
6192355001578374 You are a stranger until proven otherwise. Your deeds are that of a stranger. Medenegshe, you are not part of us.
6192355001578378 Stop pushing!
6192355001578379 By oylgono ugyb. I don't understand what you mean.
6192355001578380 You want blood… Why is it always blood?
6192355001578377 Show us that you're on our side. Show us that your knife can trace the Lines. Show us that you can cut.\nBring us 大 维拉德. A weakling cannot do that. Then we will listen.

6192355001433252 What are you doing here?
6192355001433255 Where's the director?
6192355001433256 It's not going particularly well, as you can see.
6192355001433251 Nice meeting you, fellow traveler. How's it going? Enjoying the play?
6192355001433258 Very much so.
6192355001433261 Eh… I've seen worse.
6192355001433257 The director went out to have a smoke. Got exhausted watching your torture.\nSo here I thought, how about I pay a visit to my 同行的旅人? You must be exhausted from his… unique vision.
6192355001433260 I'm less than a person to him.
6192355001433264 I think… the idea is I'm supposed to value life higher because of this.
6192355001433259 You don't say! The man's weird… How did it even occur to him? A person stumbles, and instead of lending a hand, he pushes them down further? Pours oil under their feet?\nIt's completely beyond me.
6192355001433263 What do you mean…?
6192355001433262 Listen, fellow traveler… I have a proposal. And I'll be blunt.\nWould you like to stop all this torture, the punishment? The hunger, the pain, the divine plagues of Egypt you endure for each new death?
6192355001433266 What bony monstrosity?
6192355001433269 How would you even achieve this? By strangling the director?
6192355001433270 And you want my soul in exchange, of course.
6192355001433265 Exactly what I meant. I'll replace you. I'm itching to act…\nYou'll become strong again. No more hunger pangs. The bony monstrosity we've all seen out on the square will vanish.\nAnd you'll no longer be punished for mistakes. You're about to perish without a single achievement… Look how pale you are. No offense.
6192355001433272 And no more stupid penalties? Where do I sign?
6192355001433273 All right, so what's the catch? Don't say there isn't one.
6192355001433274 Huh… I thought you were a rag-and-bone man.
6192355001433271 Nah, I'm a light technician here… Lighting the way, so to speak. Immortell will listen to me. Don't you worry about that.\nAll you need to give is your consent. No soul required.
6192355001433276 And here you were saying you didn't want my soul.
6192355001433277 "Give me what you don't know you have at home." Yeah, I've heard this one.
6192355001433278 Hm… I'll be the only one to suffer loss, right? No one else gets hurt?
6192355001433275 If we strike this deal, you'll be free to die as much as you can bear. You can become Death's next-door neighbor, so to speak.\nBut in exchange, you'll lose something. Something big and important. And I won't tell you what it is. It might hurt incredibly. Or not at all.
6192355001433280 Deal. Not for myself, but to get better at helping others. All these shackles slow me down.
6192355001433281 Deal. It's too hard.
6192355001433282 No deal. You want to take something, the absence of which would turn any victory to ash. I don't know what, but I sense it.
6192355001433285 No deal. Tedious bullshit is better than the fear of uncertainty.
6192355001433279 Pull the cloth out of your brains and think about it. Hard. These aren't just words. I <i>am</i> taking something from you, the <i>real</i> you. No huge loss, though… Maybe!\nBut you'll be free to walk the Town. Take risks, get into fights, be daring.
6192355001433284 I'm sure. I'll manage without shady proposals.
6192355001433289 You know… I've changed my mind. Let's make a deal. No more penalties for death. In exchange for… something.
6192355001433283 Are you sure? I'll only offer once. You won't be able to change your mind or rewind time.\nThe choice you make now will stay with you until the end.
6192355001433287 I'm sure. No more penalties for death. In exchange for… something.
6192355001433288 You know… I've changed my mind. I'll try to bear all this… creativity.
6192355001433286 Are you sure? You won't be able to change your mind or rewind time. The choice you make now will stay with you until the end.
6192355001433291 See you around.
6192355001433292 I feel uneasy…
6192355001433290 Well, 同行的旅人, you've made your choice. Go out there. I will act.
6192355001433295 So what do you propose?
6192355001433294 So you haven't even noticed? Impressively unobservant… but no matter. It will disappear anyway.

6192355001433558 I didn't come in here through the door. It works differently for me… somehow.
6192355001433559 I guess.
6192355001433557 We have this… little demon around. A repugnant creature! Even though I grew kinda used to it… But now it escaped from the Theatre into the big world! Slipped out! And I've no idea what he dragged with him.\n…Wait a second. It happened because of you, didn't it? You opened the door to come in—and he slipped out through the crack!
6192355001433561 By "your" theatre you mean this version… with the candles, right?
6192355001433562 So I'm free to go? There won't be any punishment?
6192355001433560 Then it's up to you to find him! I'm not going outside, I'm too busy here.\nIt's unheard of—to have something escape into the Town from <i>our</i> theatre. It's never happened before. I shudder to imagine the consequences…
6192355001433564 I won't. Am I free to go?
6192355001433565 So there won't be any punishment this time?
6192355001433563 Yes. This one. It took me four hours to place the candles right, by the way, so don't you dare step on them.
6192355001433567 "Theatre of Death"?
6192355001433568 Got it. Thanks. I prefer rat-catching to dying.
6192355001433566 Go. Shoo! The rat is out—that's your punishment. He's your headache now, if you find him.\nJust keep in mind… he's an actor too, in his own way. When he's in character, there's no use asking him about the Theatre of Death. Better try catching him somewhere nearby…
6192355001433570 I think I understand. Kind of like "theatre of operations," yes?
6192355001433571 And good luck to you, too.
6192355001433569 Oh… no. Sorry. I misspoke. Anyway, why are you still here? Go!
6192355001583252 Closed? How?
6192355001583857 Sick? 为什么？
6192355001583251 That's it. There's no one here anymore. The Theatre is closed, we're all sick of it. Literally nauseated.
6192355001583859 Where?
6192355001583886 为什么？
6192355001583858 Clearly not closed well enough, since you're here anyway. But everyone else is gone.
6192355001583885 Is he, like… gone gone?
6192355001583884 Because the director went out for a smoke—four hours ago. Anyone would get sick from smoking a cigarette that long. And he took the coat!
6192355001583888 So there won't be anymore pantomimes at night?
6192355001583889 I'm afraid I will return.
6192355001583887 How should I know? I'm a junior prop designer, no one reports to me. But the Theatre is empty now. Do not come back.
6192355001583892 So that's what the 同行的旅人 took from me… Philosophy discussions. Could have been worse.
6192355001583891 Pantomimes? Oh, pantomimes… No, there will still be pantomimes. They're <i>there,</i> you see. I'm talking about <i>here.</i>
6192355001583897 You're saying the talks with the director aren't the only thing I've lost? What have I gotten myself into…
6192355001583898 I'm not greedy.
6192355001583896 Thieves rarely take a single coin. They usually grab the whole purse. Just saying.
6192355001433551 Rat Catcher
6192355001433574 你是谁？
6192355001433575 Aren't you the rat that escaped from the Theatre?
6192355001433580 I remember you. You're "the thing from below the ground." Or are you? Where did you get those legs?
6192355001433573 Just look at what you've grown! Unbelievable. The scale of your personality is staggering.
6192355001433583 The 老鼠先知, huh…
6192355001702151 But...
6192355001433578 Are you slow? The name's written on the right.
6192355001433582 Fair enough. What are these poles?
6192355001433585 Do you really have no hands…?
6192355001433581 Yes. Yes, yes, yes. A child of old theatrical rags. The inhabitant of all musty places. The performer of a small but memorable role, "the thing from below the ground." Can't give you an autograph—I'm short of hands.\nEnough. This humble stage has objects more remarkable than me!
6192355001433587 My clothes aren't so bad, either.
6192355001433588 I can do whatever I want. Or… at least I could before I got cursed.
6192355001433589 Fine. So what's that thing over the square?
6192355001433586 Like you do! You swing your paws whenever the script allows, but you can't even punch Fat 维拉德's face—or jerk my tail.\nAt least I got this magnificent costume for my suffering. What do you have?
6192355001433591 I didn't understand a word of that.
6192355001433592 Wait, but…
6192355001433590 See this ulcer? A metastasis in the world's body. It grew because you keep dying, jackass.\nYour deaths are make believe, but the world rots for real. That's how big a character you are, Ripper. Impressive!
6192355001433594 My mistakes hurt the whole world? That's not fair.
6192355001433593 An ulcer! A tumor! An abscess! A boil! How can I make it more clear? And you call yourself a doctor…\nOr did you think your deaths only concerned you? An actor is inseparable from the audience—they're a manifestation of their expectations. So if you keep suffering, sooner or later everyone will.
6192355001433596 But you just said…
6192355001433597 I'm not fretting.
6192355001433595 More fair than you think. \nOh, but stop fretting. It's just a piece of wood. Or bone, maybe… some pranker just stuck it in the ground, that's all.
6192355001433599 I keep my arms in check. A surgeon's hands are too valuable a tool.
6192355001433600 See you around, then.
6192355001513051 You're a funny creature…
6192355001433598 Look. Whenever you find yourself in the Theatre again and the stage is empty, know that I must be close. We'll continue our improvisation then.\nFor now, enjoy your freedom and have fun swinging your arms.
6192355001514103 I'm human.
6192355001514104 But last time I saw you, you were floating! Or was that a different rat?
6192355001514102 What a rude question. Where did <i>you</i> get <i>yours?</i>
6192355001514106 So you're an actor?
6192355001514105 布拉克. When an actor on stage gets a bullet through their head, do you also pester them about how they managed to cure that when you meet them the day after? No. You don't even ask that yourself. You die, stand back up, dust yourself off, and keep on going.\nThese are just legs.
6192355001433602 I'm not doing this on purpose, no.
6192355001435651 How about taking my place and trying for yourself?
6192355001435652 That thing above you… The ulcer… It became bigger.
6192355001433601 I've been wondering… Perhaps you're doing this on purpose? Botching lines, falling from the stage? Constantly kicking the bucket?\nYou just want to see what it all leads to, don't you?
6192355001435654 So what does it mean?
6192355001435655 Will it keep growing?
6192355001435656 Are you sure it's because of me?
6192355001435653 And do note a curious thing: it's not Earth rotting. It's Sky. This tumor is growing up.
6192355001435658 布拉克.
6192355001435659 I'm as much 布拉克 as you're the 老鼠先知.
6192355001435657 I don't know. I don't know anything. I'm small fry myself, 布拉克… It's 布拉克, isn't it?
6192355001435677 Neither do I.
6192355001435678 I'll try.
6192355001435676 You should be more careful, 布拉克. I don't like this tumor at all.
6192355001435680 Not all good things are symmetrical. To the contrary, actually…
6192355001435681 The heart is on the side, too. The left side.
6192355001611162 Some people here have no hands at all.
6192355001435679 Do you know how one can tell a simple mole from a malignant melanoma?\nIt's symmetry. Natural processes are symmetrical. An arm on the left, an arm on the right… Each action bears a symmetrical reaction… but illness is twisted. It grows to the side.
6192355001435683 Almost. But not entirely.
6192355001611163 I'm a decent doctor.
6192355001435682 It's a myth, actually. The heart is located almost directly in the center of your chest. Some doctor you are…
6192355001514109 I can see that.
6192355001514108 This tumor is malignant.
6192355001435692 Farewell? 为什么？
6192355001435693 Farewell, Rat.
6192355001435691 Farewell, 布拉克.
6192355001435695 That doesn't sound too bad.
6192355001435696 So now what?
6192355001435697 What does it have to do with you?
6192355001435694 The tumor is complete, see? The ulcer is ripe now. Grasping at the sky with its metastases, growing into it.\nNow it's sewn to the ground forever, unable to escape.
6192355001435699 How are you going to climb it? You have no hands!
6192355001435700 The tenant fits the house, I guess.
6192355001435698 Me… I'm just a trash rat, 布拉克. Field voles make nests from herbs; I make mine from rot, so to speak. I'll climb up there and inhabit it. Spitting down rot on your heads from above, heh heh heh…
6192355001435704 Don't you try to shift the blame to me. I wasn't the one who made this plague happen.
6192355001435706 I'm sorry, funny rat. I hope you don't disappear completely.
6192355001435703 It'll suck me in… and you, too… It'll suck the whole world in.\n'Cause you've rotted it all. It's all just metastases and tumors now. None of us will have hands or feet soon…

6192355001394051 安德烈·斯塔马丁
6192355001399753 What?
6192355001400551 You have a wild imagination.
6192355001399752 A kid made a gift for his 父亲. Two weeks of careful work. He kept thinking how happy 父亲 would be when he opened it… He ran into the room, stumbled, but didn't drop the box! He held it out to 父亲…\nThen 父亲 pulled a razor from behind his back and cut the kid's face.
6192355001400553 Why are you telling me this?
6192355001400552 Here's another famous one. During the previous war, an 士官 came to a mother with two children in a camp. "Choose which one we kill, the son or the daughter," he said. "If you refuse, we'll shoot both."\nThe mother gave them the daughter. They shot her.
6192355001400555 Enough!
6192355001400556 Go on.
6192355001400554 Oh, and listen to this one…
6192355001400558 你想要什么？
6192355001400562 You're delirious.
6192355001400557 That's the inquisition. I am an 审判官's daughter. They're craftsmen, the 审判官s… <i>crafting people.</i> That's what they call their work process. "Crafting people."\nTomorrow, they'll be here. What do we do?
6192355001400560 So what?
6192355001400561 Don't touch old people. And don't touch <i>me</i> with your words!
6192355001400559 I think treachery is the worst sin. Don't you agree? Betraying a warm, living person who trusts you.\nHere's the story: Find a gullible person. An old one. Old people are helpless, you know. Make them follow you. And then… See where I'm going with this? That's what the inquisition does to people.
6192355001400564 I'm not that bad.
6192355001400565 Well… I'm far from heroic, anyway.
6192355001400566 I betrayed my 父亲… I doubt you can surprise me anymore, girl.
6192355001400563 Nothing. I just want to look him in the eye. You—never approach them, never touch them. They'll make <i>you</i> the villain. Do you get it?
6192355001374462 Voronika
6192355001317156 What for?
6192355001387451 Go ahead, if you're not afraid.
6192355001388951 No. Shaking the hands of strangers is a terrible idea these days.
6192355001317155 Hello, doctor. Can I shake your hand?
6192355001387461 My hands are completely ordinary.
6192355001388957 Let's shake, then. Aren't you afraid to catch the plague?
6192355001387460 You are a man of action. People respect you. The say you have golden hands.
6192355001388953 You have a firm handshake. Unexpected.
6192355001388954 You're a brave woman. Few people have the courage to touch others these days.
6192355001388952 No.
6192355001388956 I see… You two must belong to the same circle of unbreakable women. Are you a mathematician, too?
6192355001388958 A friend of who?
6192355001388955 I suppose.\nI'm Aysa Klyo妮娜. A friend of Yulia Lyuricheva. She needs you.
6192355001388960 Wow…
6192355001388961 I respect that.
6192355001388964 Your voice… It's like I hear iron clanking.
6192355001388959 No. I'm an engineer. But I help her with calculations.
6192355001388963 What trap?
6192355001388967 Traps all around… Fate again? Some inevitable evil?
6192355001388962 She needs to talk to you. She wants to help you avoid a trap.
6192355001388966 Where?
6192355001388970 No.
6192355001388965 A sturdy one. Are you coming?
6192355001388969 Where?
6192355001388971 No.
6192355001388968 Possible. Are you coming?
6192355001388973 Oh… You mean the Trammel? I've heard of it.
6192355001388974 I know the place. Go. Let them know I'm coming.
6192355001388972 A library in the Chine. That's where we live and work.
6192355001507907 Are you two colleagues?
6192355001507906 She's a mathematician.
6192355001374463 Aysa
6192355001324652 Farewell.
6192355001325455 Oh well…
6192355001324651 Where once a person was, now but a gap remains. This rupture will not mend.
6192355001325454 Reflection
6192355001374201 
6192355001344352 换生灵
6192355001374453 
6192355001356452 Okay, okay.
6192355001451701 I'm healthy.
6192355001356451 Halt!
6192355001451703 Take a look. I'm healthy.
6192355001451704 Calm down, 士官. I'm a doctor too.
6192355001451702 Show me your hands.
6192355001451706 Where's Block? I'm on an errand.
6192355001451705 Three steps back. Rear—march!
6192355001451708 It's called Crowstone. And calm down, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
6192355001451712 I'm telling you, I'm healthy! I'm leaving anyway. Don't get jumpy…
6192355001451707 …There a stone, looks like a bird's beak. That's where the fighting's moved to. Now, civilian! Three steps back—and—<i>march!</i>
6192355001451710 A courier must have come here with papers for 布洛克将军…
6192355001451711 I want Block.
6192355001451709 I'm the doctor. 你想要什么？
6192355001453053 Loyalist
6192355001405073 I got nothing.
6192355001405074 Was there a fight here? Who fought?
6192355001405120 Here's some water.
6192355001453054 Here's something stiffer.
6192355001405072 How about a drink, buddy? A drink of water… or something stiffer, if you aren't cheap as hell?
6192355001405079 Any survivors?
6192355001405078 We fought ourselves. It's our boys against our boys now. Don't ask stupid questions.
6192355001405082 Don't worry, soldier. You'll survive. Maybe.
6192355001451673 It's not enough that the sand pest mows you down? You have to shoot each other, too?
6192355001405081 The fighting moved toward the Factory. And ended there, I guess.
6192355001405085 It's not a pox.
6192355001405124 Just wash your hands, and only drink water that's been boiled.
6192355001405125 It is. So think less. That'll protect you.
6192355001405083 Is that sand pox really… transmitted by thought? Heard about that?
6192355001405119 No.
6192355001405121 Say, did a civilian come through here? With papers for the general?
6192355001405118 Got a smoke?
6192355001405123 Where exactly?
6192355001405122 For the general? Maybe. The general's in the Town—look for him there.
6192355001451672 Where's Ashes?
6192355001451671 …How the hell did we get into this? We've lost three-quarters of our troops in two days—General Ashes' troops!\nThere were five times fewer of us at the Fords, can you believe that? And just eleven killed in action. One hundred and eighteen wounded. Ashes has always protected his people. But here… all hell broke loose under us. Three quarters! That's six hundred people pushing daisies.
6192355001453055 士官
6192355001526652 Who?
6192355001526653 So you can see them, too?
6192355001526654 你是谁, kid?
6192355001526651 Where did they come from?
6192355001526656 I don't know.
6192355001526657 From the steppe, apparently. Where else?
6192355001526658 The Earth brought them to life, kid. That's the kind of earth we walk on.
6192355001526655 The bulls. Wake up and look around!
6192355001526660 Doesn't seem so.
6192355001526661 I hope.
6192355001526659 They're kinda hard to miss! Are they not real? Like a… hallucination?
6192355001526663 Aurochs. The bulls of steppe legend.
6192355001526664 Bos Turokh… That's what they call the bull that created the world. I thought he was unique. One of a kind.
6192355001526665 No idea, kid. I'm as bemused as you are.
6192355001526662 What <i>are</i> they?
6192355001526667 That's the name. "Baur Meges." A tale of the world's creation.
6192355001526668 Perhaps… So 萨巴's wish did come true. Or was it her plan?
6192355001526669 Are you scared?
6192355001526666 All the streets are like… those old tales of yours. Like that book, "Baur Meges." Is this it? Did the steppe flood us all?
6192355001526671 Yeah? Well, I am.
6192355001526672 Never again. That much is true.
6192355001526670 Scared? Are you nuts? When will I ever see anything like this again?
6192355001526674 I don't know. Let's walk around… and witness what we've done.
6192355001526675 This is what I wanted, you know. To preserve things almost extinct. Things that would otherwise be ground to dust by time, because tomorrow had no place for them.
6192355001526673 What will become of… everything, now? Huh? Come on, tell me! Hey!
6192355001526677 I… I failed him.
6192355001526678 Well… it is how it is.
6192355001526679 Don't. Leave me.
6192355001526676 Me? I'm a friend of 史迪奇's, the kid you let die. You can call me Measly.\nI'm here to give you a tour of the Town. In his place. Oh, how he wished he'd stand here in my place. But he can't.\nYou failed him, so I'll pretend to be him, for you.
6192355001526681 That's maudlin enough, thank you!
6192355001526682 He was like a son to me, too.
6192355001526683 …
6192355001526680 And he was so proud! Said you took him in as an apprentice. Said you'd make him into a great doctor. You were like a 父亲 to him… He'd never seen his real one, anyway. Yeah.
6192355001526685 Who?
6192355001526684 Fine, I'll not say another word. I don't need to. You'll eat your own heart out for this by yourself, so why bother?\nBetter you tell me: Where did they come from?
6192355001526687 I'd never been here, either… Until recently.
6192355001526688 So how do you like it?
6192355001526689 This is no place for children. It's antithetical to your world. Kids and beasts… inhabit the opposing ends of the vale of life.
6192355001526686 I never thought I'd end up here… No matter how hard I tried to get inside, I couldn't. Admittedly, I was pretty scared of this place…
6192355001526691 "Vale." As in "valley."
6192355001526692 Vale of life, veil of death, wails of fate…
6192355001526693 Yeah, it's an odd idiom. I don't know what it means, either. Read it somewhere.
6192355001526690 "The veil of life"? I've only heard the veil of death…
6192355001526695 Those things you describe are in hell. We'll see them, in due time.
6192355001526696 Well, it does smell of meat… Blood, at least.
6192355001526697 It <i>is</i> a factory building.
6192355001526694 Thought it was just a factory building. Or storage, maybe. Cold. Hooks, chains, meat smells…
6192355001526699 It's the Earth turning about in her slumber. This place is closest to her.
6192355001526700 There's this pit here… Hell's gate. The howling comes from there.
6192355001526701 Those are the spirits of ancient bulls saying hello. Allow me to translate: "What are these <i>humans</i> doing here? Especially that small one?"
6192355001526698 And what are those sounds? Is there a beast howling? Or just the wind?
6192355001526703 That was a serious answer.
6192355001526704 Are you still surprised by anything?
6192355001526705 Everything is alive now, kid. So it expresses itself the best it can.
6192355001526702 Ugh. I was asking seriously!
6192355001526707 It was the 凯恩s' territory. A different town. Ours, but different.
6192355001526708 Just don't call the odonghs "worms" to their face. It offends them.
6192355001526709 You're right. It's strange.
6192355001526706 At first, I thought the steppe couldn't reach this quarter. The Upper Town, the Stone Yard… never welcomed the steppe. It was tough for them here. Too high. Lads used to say 虫人are best suited to the soil, but this place is all stone and sky.
6192355001526711 Not exactly. But they are connected to Earth.
6192355001526712 They do have faces. Are they not people to you?
6192355001526710 What face? They <i>are</i> worms. Aren't they? Born of the Earth… Eating Earth, hearing Earth. Earthworms.
6192355001526714 I don't know. I've never seen it.
6192355001526715 Bullshit.
6192355001526716 It's true, but be quiet. It's not nice to talk about it out loud.
6192355001526713 Is it true that those guys and the 草药新娘s have their own language? And their own rites, too? And they marry?
6192355001526718 Well… times change.
6192355001526719 Pray to what? Time flows differently now. Can you feel it?
6192355001526720 Go over and ask them.
6192355001526717 Why are they here? Why are they all sitting by the Crucible, looking at the Cathedral? What do they care? Did they come to pray?
6192355001526722 I think we'd better stay quiet.
6192355001526723 What is there to ask? It's all obvious.
6192355001526721 Like hell… You ask them.
6192355001526725 Look around. Don't you find it believable?
6192355001526726 They're big talkers.
6192355001526724 The 凯恩s said the Cathedral changes time itself. That's why they made it. But who would believe that…?
6192355001526728 Anyway, kid. I clearly see what I've done now. I guess it's for the best.
6192355001526727 Fair enough.
6192355001526731 Saved all the things that surround us now. They were supposed to be ground down by time, to vanish. But now, they persevere.
6192355001526732 So that's what the doctor's oath was all about. Preserving life. I preserved all living things.
6192355001526733 Well… I made life interesting. It goes on, still as terrible and strange as before. People will have to find new roles in this ecosystem.
6192355001526730 What <i>have</i> you done?
6192355001526735 Yes, kid. Even the sand pest.
6192355001526736 <i>All</i> things.
6192355001526734 Even the sand pest?

6192355001414856 Enough with the comedy, where is she?
6192355001414864 What sheet music?
6192355001414855 I thought you'd never ask! Her Cataclysmic Majesty would like the army band to play her tune. She sent three copies of her songbook, on the backs of three couriers, and then moved on ahead to conduct this choir herself.
6192355001414858 What concert?
6192355001414857 You'll find the maestra in the 城镇大厅. The Town will shake from root to root when mighty trumpets ring the air!
6192355001414860 …She's destroying the Polyhedron?
6192355001414859 The Symphony of the Falling Tower!
6192355001414862 I'll stop this circus.
6192355001414863 Huh…

6192355001426154 Whom?
6192355001426159 What are you doing here?
6192355001426153 So? Did they execute her?
6192355001426156 Who?
6192355001426157 What for?
6192355001426158 你是谁？
6192355001426155 额...这间房子的女主人。
6192355001426161 为什么？
6192355001426164 But <i>who was executed?</i> Tell me, now!
6192355001426160 I mean… this is a public shelter, isn't it? "Home for the Living"? Means anyone can come in. Like, if you got your house burned, or want to escape quarantine. That's what she said.\nAnd now she's asked someone to replace her.
6192355001426163 Kill the general? What do you mean, kill the general?
6192355001426167 Oh, why do you have to be such an idiot, 格拉薇尔!
6192355001426162 So, here's the thing. The mistress of the house, she said, "I'm gonna go kill the general. 'Cause the general, he put my dad, Captain 拉薇尔, through a court martial, for insubordinate conduct, and then my dad got sentenced and executed as a traitor and deserter."\nAnd then she said, "Fate sent him to me now. 布洛克将军, that is."
6192355001426169 所以她去司令部了？城镇大厅？多久之前的事？
6192355001426166 The shelter thing… <i>The shelter thing…</i>
6192355001426168 What were you thinking? How could you let her <i>go?</i> You morons!
6192355001426165 Just like that. Got herself a gun and went to the headquarters… And to us, she said, "Take my household, and manage it well." So that the whole shelter thing wouldn't end with her, right…\nSo now we're having a look around… Sorry if we disturbed anything.
6192355001426171 Half an hour…
6192355001426172 No. No! This is insane!
6192355001426173 Get lost, all of you.
6192355001426170 I mean… You won't catch her on time, unkind sir. Half an hour ago or so.
6192355001579969 She did find a way to serve the people, after all… So why does she need replacement?
6192355001579970 But <i>who was executed?</i> Tell me, now!
6192355001579968 I mean… she distributes bread from here… like, if your house got burned, or you want to escape quarantine. Means anyone can come in. She doesn't lock the door, either. The Shelter <i>is</i> a shelter.\nAnd now she asked for someone to replace her.

6192355001434051 You must think I'm nuts if you believe I'll just… let this slide!
6192355001433555 He's back! He's back! So, did you catch your murderer? Your man of black?
6192355001434056 Who was it?
6192355001434052 …Are you mad?
6192355001434055 Why the hell?
6192355001434059 I don't want to play your games anymore, either. Good luck with your life.
6192355001563822 I trusted you…
6192355001434054 Anyway. That was a good game. But we don't want to play with you anymore.
6192355001434061 So <i>I'm</i> the guilty one? Come on!
6192355001434064 You're no better. You told me you'd found a murderer… <i>the</i> murderer. Was that fair?
6192355001563826 I treated you as equals this whole time. Clearly I shouldn't have.
6192355001434060 We took you in, and you were greedy! We told you, there were rules. And you haven't written a single note…\nYou didn't play fair. Yeah.
6192355001434063 Who did he kill?
6192355001434062 A murderer.
6192355001563816 That was an ugly and dirty thing to do. You should have just asked me directly.
6192355001563815 …No. He's not <i>the</i> murderer. And you are a bunch of two-faced punks.
6192355001563814 Barin from the Skinners, that's certain. He hunted us with a knife afterwards, 'cause we'd seen him! For real!\nPerhaps he did your Old Man in too? Whaddyathink?
6192355001563818 I might have.
6192355001563819 You did a dirty thing. Who could ever believe you, after this?
6192355001563817 And? Like you'd do anything to help us! You've got a ton on your plate already.
6192355001563824 I need to rethink something.
6192355001563825 I was thinking you had some kind of conscience.
6192355001563823 Well, what did you think? That we're a bunch of angels?
6192355001427651 Yawn
6192355001429854 
6192355001431041 Huh? What do you mean by that?
6192355001431042 I did, of course. Who wouldn't?
6192355001431043 I didn't cheat. All I did was take the path of least resistance.
6192355001431040 Wanted to cheat, did you?
6192355001431045 What good thing?
6192355001433056 Not the worst of options.
6192355001433057 It was what I wanted in the first place. To remain myself, at all times.
6192355001431044 You turned down a good thing. You shouldn't have. So, remain yourself now, as punishment.
6192355001431047 I am.
6192355001431048 No. I'm not.
6192355001431046 You're afraid of death, then?
6192355001431050 Not terribly.
6192355001433051 No. Not a fan.
6192355001433052 We have a special relationship. It's a professional thing.
6192355001431049 You are… Everybody is. No fan of the Reaper, are you?
6192355001433054 It's not something I'm running away from.
6192355001433055 They say running does your health good. Proven fact.
6192355001433053 What kind of professional runs from death? Talk about not putting your burial coins where your mouth is…
6192355001433059 As you wish, then.
6192355001433060 It's all right. I'll figure it out on my own. That smart-looking guy over there will tell me. Won't be able to resist telling me.
6192355001433058 That's the problem, you're past explaining! Your insides are full up, no more room to stuff in this knowledge. So don't take it personally! I'm not trying to be mean, I just can't tell you. It is impossible.
6192355001435667 What's going on outside? What's the Town up to? Was it shelled, or not?
6192355001435668 I did want to!
6192355001435666 Was it that difficult a task? Not at all, if you ask me. Of course, it would've involved some legwork. But you were given enough time.\nAnd you never found those wretched papers, meaning you never wanted to. Move along.
6192355001435670 Who does something like this? Stopping the whole thing just short of the denouement?
6192355001435671 Can I come back? Please? I'll act my part better. I'll find the papers.
6192355001435672 Whatever. I'm sick of your show already. Should I talk to Immortell, then?
6192355001435669 Town's gone, my dear. The show has been interrupted due to a lack of interest on the part of the protagonist. Right at the climax, too!
6192355001435674 I see. Well.
6192355001435675 It's nothing but questions with you people…
6192355001435673 That's a question for you, sir. Not for me.
6192355001429858 利爪
6192355001431026 And…? What's with the pomp and circumstance?
6192355001431027 Uh… I didn't…
6192355001431028 Aren't you worried your beak will snap off from all that self-importance?
6192355001431025 The following is a certificate of confirmation: This is to confirm that you, here present, declined the terms offered to you and, in order to alleviate your predicament, refused the task incumbent upon you based upon the number of your encounters with death.
6192355001431030 Yeah, that's right.
6192355001431031 That expression is extreme skepticism, beakhead.
6192355001431032 And this is that event. Right?
6192355001431029 …In reciprocity for said alleviation, you, here present, agreed to waive an important future event in what might be termed your destiny, the nature of said event being unknown to you. Confirmed by the present document as well as your facial expression.
6192355001431034 Harsh. So can I go now?
6192355001431035 Looks like death, pal.
6192355001431033 …And now this event has come to pass. The game is over for you at this point. Tomorrow has been canceled, as have all subsequent days.
6192355001431037 Come on… I was just about to make a complaint.
6192355001431038 Well… there's no arguing with that, I suppose.
6192355001431039 A deal's a deal. It's only fair.
6192355001431036 Exactly so. This decision is final and without appeal.
6192355001435661 What's going on? Where am I?
6192355001435662 Let me through! I need to get back to town. I didn't make it on time…
6192355001435660 Tsk, tsk. You're late. For shame, sir. For shame.
6192355001435664 Ugh.
6192355001435665 Is there really nothing that can be done?
6192355001435663 You're late. You quite definitively didn't make it. Come on in, collect your payment. Don't detain us further.

6192355001467451 Rehearsals are boring. I prefer to learn by doing.
6192355001467053 Ah, there you are. Time for our first rehearsal! \nThis is all very emotional, but don't get anxious. It's just a study, not a full play yet. So take your time and get into character.
6192355001467453 What do I need to do?
6192355001469551 You look like a goof-ball... is that intentional too?
6192355001467452 We'll have a run-through of a small part of our play. Remember: your time is limited! At two past noon the theater will close and we'll have to part ways. So you won't be able to finish your script anyway.\nDo not despair. It's intentional.
6192355001467455 As if it wasn't before...
6192355001467456 You're have your rehearsal, funny man, but I have business to do. Actual business...
6192355001467467 Warm up my vocal cords, huh? I can do that.
6192355001467454 Take this time to study the space and objects, warm up your vocal cords... and generally prepare for the big show.\nAnd mind the time! The stage is yours until two o'clock. Now off you go. The clock is ticking!

6192355001592758 "Completely"? That's uncanny…

6192355001495657 Well done learning all those long words. What do I do with money now?
6192355001495652 Any chance you might have seen the hunger and ruin going around? It's called "emergency conditions."\nTo help you maintain a semblance of life, our kind benefactor, 审判官 阿格莱雅 莉莉奇, introduced centralized distribution of food in exchange for coupons. It's called "rationing due to low stock."
6192355001495655 Sure.
6192355001495656 Keep them. I'll find sane merchants.
6192355001594802 So those are the candy wrappers my 同行的旅人 was selling…
6192355001495654 Don't offer money to the merchants. We've got ears everywhere. You'll get whatever the 审判官 decides you're worthy of. It's called "basic provisions."\nSo are you taking the coupons or not?
6192355001494158 Yes.
6192355001495658 No, just to chat.

6192355001509395 你给我的是什么？
6192355001509390 这是给你的。
6192355001509397 劳拉！什么...不，等等...“处决”？
6192355001509398 What have you done to her, you pieces of shit?!
6192355001509399 哦，格拉薇尔，你做了什么....
6192355001509396 扰乱分子已被处决。我们在她尸体发现了一个文件，在这：“我，劳拉·拉薇尔，独自策划了对布洛克将军的谋杀。其余无人知晓我的计划。若某人声称鲁宾，布拉克，或芬恩乃我的同谋，无需理会。一人做事一人当。”
6192355001509401 No... No, no, no...
6192355001509402 尸体在哪...？
6192355001509400 她来过这，掏出了武器。我们对扰乱分子可从不留情。 
6192355001510564 我是布拉克.
6192355001509389 Well, I doubt you are.
6192355001517051 I'm all three. What is it?
6192355001510563 你是布拉克? 芬恩？鲁宾?
6192355001510562 Aide
6192355001514068 
6192355001517659 Yes.
6192355001517661 No.
6192355001517662 Well, you're one hell of a judge…
6192355001517658 They aren't here. Because of <i>you.</i>
6192355001517664 We'll see about that.
6192355001517665 True. I can't.
6192355001517666 No one can save anyone.
6192355001517663 Go away. We don't <i>need</i> you. You can't save anyone.
6192355001517753 I know…
6192355001517660 卡佩拉 is alive. And I won't let her die.
6192355001592480 可汗 is alive. I'll drag him out in the end.
6192355001517752 可汗's gone. 卡佩拉's gone.
6192355001658555 Better than nothing.
6192355001658556 I understand. I'm leaving.
6192355001658554 It's safe here. The Tower is impenetrable for the disease. We'll take care of ourselves—better than you did.

6192355001527052 
6192355001527053 
6192355001527054 
6192355001527753 …All the while, she was leaving ammo cartridges on train tracks.
6192355001527754 …All the while, she was catching bugs in jars and observing them.
6192355001527755 …She <i>was</i> proper, though. Carried a book around, sometimes. Was a brilliant distraction while we were busy filling our pockets with stolen candy.
6192355001527752 She always had it in her.\nDo you recall? Adults could never see what such a prim and proper girl could want from being in your gang. A daughter to old Captain 拉薇尔! She surely ought to stay ensconced among her books…
6192355001527757 And the most taciturn of us all, 坏格里夫.
6192355001527758 So she's… listening to her heart and acting, huh?
6192355001527756 You see, she puts her stock in deeds and not in words. So 斯塔克 was always close to her; for he would hear his heart, and act. A trait you share, 布拉克.
6192355001527760 And then one couldn't dream of a more reliable accomplice…
6192355001527761 I never figured out what she saw in us…
6192355001527759 It's not about a hidden inner fire—but she had real fun with your antics. A lot of your suggestions got a "no" from her—but then, at times, a "yes."
6192355001527763 Can't argue with that.
6192355001527764 Does a lot of stupid things, yes, the ginger clown. But, you were saying…?
6192355001527762 He speaks so much yet does so much more.
6192355001527766 I don't do slaps. But I get it.
6192355001527767 So they'll talk back to her, with bullets! Oh, tenegh…
6192355001527765 Some things cannot be said with words, but come only with slaps, or bullets, or warming hands, or dripped from waterskins… You know it, sir? This is the only way she can express her 格里夫 for her departed 父亲.
6192355001527769 In the past tense? Don't you dare. She <i>loves</i> him.
6192355001527770 I do.
6192355001527768 You know how much she loved her 父亲.
6192355001527751 劳拉's Reflection
6192355001549152 What are you talking about?
6192355001560251 I know what you mean.
6192355001549151 It keeps running off at the last moment…
6192355001560253 Happiness, like everyone else.
6192355001560254 A villain.
6192355001560255 An answer to a riddle.
6192355001560258 The plague.
6192355001560252 What are you after, big man?
6192355001560257 You uh… You're not planning to eat it, are you?
6192355001560262 Cats are like that… No catching them unless they want to be caught.
6192355001560256 A cat.
6192355001560260 Why are you harassing the poor animal?
6192355001560261 I'm not in the cat chasing business. Cats are fast, and I'm clumsy.
6192355001560259 Oh… I thought you were chasing the same cat we are.
6192355001560264 Is there even such a thing as a <i>regular</i> cat?
6192355001560265 Let me guess, it speaks?
6192355001560266 Can it do tricks or something?
6192355001560263 It's not a regular cat, okay?
6192355001560268 Why don't you feed it? You won't see the cat, but you will see the food. Should make it easier to chase down.
6192355001560269 Could be the ghost of a long-dead cat. Leave it be.
6192355001560267 It's a see-through cat, that's what it is.
6192355001560271 Not really. I had a hamster when I was your age. I'm allergic to cats.
6192355001560272 I kept mice and several rats. No cats allowed in the 布拉克 household.
6192355001560273 Choosing the right bait is half the hunt.
6192355001560274 I wish I knew more about bulls. Mine isn't invisible, but it sure isn't <i>regular,</i> either.
6192355001560275 Sure do.
6192355001560270 That's a great plan! You sure know a thing or two about cats, don't you?
6192355001560277 An invisible cat? Probably invisible mice.
6192355001560278 Cat love milk, don't they?
6192355001560279 Try radishes, or some parsley.
6192355001560284 Empty promises work best with invisible cats.
6192355001560276 So what do we feed it?
6192355001560287 I don't believe in cats in general, visible or invisible.
6192355001560281 I'm just kidding. Get some milk, or cream, or whatever…
6192355001560280 Oh, come on! You don't believe us, do you?
6192355001560286 I've got some, though I'd prefer you lot drink it. It's good for your bones.
6192355001560292 Not a drop. I'm not a cat, am I?
6192355001560285 Have you got milk?
6192355001560289 Stop fidgeting, I'm not in a rush.
6192355001560290 I can handle that…
6192355001560291 It's a deal.
6192355001560288 Oh! Oh! How about a trade? Here, in my pocket… no, no, that's a bone… marbles, bullets… Gah, I need some time to fish it out. \nGo ahead and pour the milk. I'll have it out by then.
6192355001560294 All right, I'll see what I can do.
6192355001560295 No can do, kids. Food is getting scarce. You should catch a bird instead.
6192355001560293 Can you get us some? Not much, just a bottle. I've got something really special for you if you do. Rare stuff, you won't find any on your own. \nFill the bowl and the treasure is yours, fair and square.
6192355001549162 So, what about my reward?
6192355001549163 Took you some time to remember the magic words.
6192355001560296 You're welcome.
6192355001549161 Um… well… thank you.
6192355001560298 Burnie?
6192355001560301 Why do you call it that?
6192355001560297 Here you go. It's inside the box. We call it Burnie.
6192355001560300 So what is Burnie good for?
6192355001560299 Burnie.
6192355001560303 So what do I do with it?
6192355001560302 I dunno.
6192355001560305 And then what?
6192355001560306 All of it? Should I eat the box, too?
6192355001560307 And then toss it over my shoulder with a prayer. Got it.
6192355001560304 Not sure… It's one of the last shmowders. Old and powerful stuff. If you get really sick, you must gobble it up in one go, and then… and then…
6192355001560309 Just like that?
6192355001560312 Thanks. I think this might come in handy.
6192355001560308 You'll see, it'll work out somehow. There you go. \nAll right, gang, back to the plan! Thanks for the help, uncle. You can go.
6192355001560311 Good luck. Give me a shout when you're ready to tackle the black cat in a dark room.
6192355001560313 Let's go, Burnie. These kids can handle themselves.
6192355001560314 Great ambush. You should get yourselves a trumpet, just to be sure.
6192355001560310 You're making too much noise. It won't come around while you're here. You should leave, and we'll wait in ambush, all quiet and such.\n<i>Here, kitty kitty, here, furry feet, here's a tasty little snack for you to drink and eat…</i>
6192355001549178 Did it work?
6192355001549179 Oh my. Who turned over the bowl?
6192355001549177 It ran off! Darn it! Why were you all in my way?
6192355001560316 You make it sound like it's my fault that it ran off.
6192355001560321 Calm down, kid. Your first try didn't work out—big deal. Try again.
6192355001560315 Oh, come on! How hard is it to grab a cat that's drinking milk? This is easy stuff! You know, fellas? We're done! I'm done running with you.
6192355001560318 I just wanted to take a peek.
6192355001560319 Now I get why the cat's invisible—it vanishes when you try to look at it. Clever.
6192355001560320 Whatever.
6192355001560317 Yeah, it is! You scared it with all your stomping around, that's what happened! Can't you just walk on your toes for a minute?
6192355001536051 Hunter
6192355001566604 What do I care?
6192355001566605 "She" who, Reflection? Your master?
6192355001566606 She sips water from the roots now. She's dead.
6192355001566603 She drinks a lot of milk.
6192355001566608 
6192355001566609 
6192355001566610 
6192355001566607 
6192355001566612 
6192355001566611 
6192355001566614 
6192355001566615 
6192355001566613 
6192355001566618 Why are you here? A person's reflection dies with them.
6192355001579954 She's not dead? Are you implying she could come back to life?
6192355001566616 Not dead, but back to Earth that cast her clay. That's what we are, we Kin. Our Mother Boddho, our Earth, will grant us one more birth. As twyre, as swevery, white whip, bodies or odonghe…\nKholboön, you speak as if born yesterday.
6192355001566620 She was born of Earth, then? And will return from Earth?
6192355001566619 Know you what death is, yargachin? The rot that takes a body within Earth? You call that death? You jest, nynehen zayla…
6192355001566622 Yeah, right.
6192355001566623 There is blood in her veins.
6192355001566621 No one knows how she became herself.\nSuspicion and fear surround a tale of one who left the steppe. She's said to be inhuman, a doll of clay and bone: Shabnak-adyg.
6192355001566625 Those are mere legends.
6192355001566624 The same can be said of Earth. So what?
6192355001566627 Are you saying that…
6192355001566628 No.
6192355001566626 My master waits for her assigned time.\nFive years ago, during the First Outbreak, Earth cast her with a secret task that must have been fulfilled back then.
6192355001566630 What do you mean, "made" her? What nonsense is this?
6192355001566631 I like her. She is… an abgai. A sister to me. I feel her care.
6192355001566629 The First Outbreak was curbed by your 父亲, however. With vicious force he changed the flow of history.\nAnd 萨巴-Usptae, 萨巴-ötün, the one called 艾斯佩蒂 by common folk, stayed behind within this world. A groomless bride, a blemish, lost, estranged from her true goals. Believes she owes her life to 伊西多, who made her, who foresaw her…
6192355001566633 It's not funny, Reflection!
6192355001566634 Are there many such steppe people?
6192355001566632 She feigns humanity quite well, and holds respect and power in the Kin.\nShe rules over this hiding-place, where steppe folk can find escape from being yoked within 奥吉姆斯基's cruel mill. Here they can hide, and heal, and run their midnight markets…
6192355001566636 So what? What use is any of that now?
6192355001566637 "Exegete?" I don't think I even know that word.
6192355001566635 The Kin respect our 萨巴, although they fear her, too. But they rely on her protection. And she's their exegete, interpreter of ancient lore. Through her, the Kin remember their rites, their speech, themselves.\nThey know it not, of course; to them, she is a flame, and they are moths.
6192355001566639 …You're trying to take over the Town. You madmen!
6192355001566640 She doesn't know what she's doing.
6192355001566638 Your 父亲, whom she worships without understanding, meant the Kin to merge into the Town to make a body whole. But we cannot, and will not!\nSo she decided to adjust the Town to the needs of the Kin. She brokers work for brides and odonghs, setting them up as dancers or couriers.  One wonders 为什么？
6192355001566642 Not always.
6192355001566643 Not human. Right. I'll try to accept that.
6192355001566644 You're lying. She <i>is</i> human. I can tell.
6192355001566641 Indeed. She is not human, after all. But love does drive her, like it drives… you. And love is blind and foolish…
6192355001566646 The Kin are slaves, Reflection. Beasts. Have been such for many years.
6192355001566647 So she's not human? I don't believe you.
6192355001566645 Yes.
6192355001566649 So you're saying she was born five years ago? The First Outbreak…
6192355001566648 Not slaves, but a hydra of apathy. They do not care for freedom, for self, or dignity, like you might value.
6192355001567351 There will be blood.
6192355001566650 Enough. Enough to flood the Town.
6192355001567353 You're saying some frightening things.
6192355001567354 There is some merit to that.
6192355001567352 <i>Baur Meges,</i> the holy tale of the Kin, does speak of the <i>self</i> as poison. It rises and bellows: "Me!"\nDiscord soon follows, then blood. Calamities, fear.\nYou've seen it all a couple days ago.\nWe do not have this. We are a whole.
6192355001579956 Fine… I'll play along. Out of respect.
6192355001579955 Yes and no. Your thoughts are stiff and narrow. You find that life and death are incompatible.\nOne can still feel her breath and catch a glimpse of her reflection. Her future still remains unsaid, and I will speak of her as if she was alive.

6192355001579052 Why would I have a leash?
6192355001579053 How about a tourniquet? It kinda looks like one.
6192355001579051 Hey doctor, you got a leash? I <i>really</i> need one.
6192355001579055 I might have one.
6192355001584751 为什么？
6192355001594822 No. And I never had one.
6192355001579054 Anyway, doctor! You got a leash or not?
6192355001579057 A shmowder, huh? Let's trade, then.
6192355001583925 No. A leash is a symbol of trust. And I won't trade away trust.
6192355001579058 I don't have a leash, but don't go far. If I ever find one in my pocket, I'll bring it to you.
6192355001594825 I'll think about it.
6192355001579056 I'm not just asking randomly. I'll trade it for a shmowder. A real, working one! It cures the plague! I totally checked!\nWe don't need shmowders in the Tower anyway—it's free from infection. But you could use one. It's not like there's any other use for the leash. For you, it's just a piece of leather. For me, it's destiny!
6192355001583900 Why would I have a leash?
6192355001583899 Tourniquet your clever ass, will you? I need an actual leash, a Soul-and-a-Half one.
6192355001583902 No one's a Soul-and-a-Half until they've got a Half.
6192355001583903 So who do you plan to deceive? I mean, <i>not</i> deceive?
6192355001583905 Thank you, kind girl.
6192355001594815 What pack…? You mistook me for someone.
6192355001583901 You mingle with 诺克金's pack. Everyone's seen that. So I was thinking, maybe they gave you one already? That would kinda make you a Soul-and-a-Half yourself… So then it's not deception, I think.\nThe Soul-and-a-Halves are like that. They got no standards, and just accept anyone who comes to them. Maybe even you.
6192355001583907 "Go in"? What?
6192355001583910 What about you? Are you a watchdog? A hound?
6192355001583911 So why do you need a leash?
6192355001583906 We Dogheads have order. We're not a pack, but an organization. There are watchdogs, shepherd dogs, service dogs, hounds… even guide dogs. The ones who go <i>in.</i>\nAnyone can become anything if they try! Not like <i>that</i> lot, completely dependent on what pet chooses you. What if it's a frog? Or a cockroach? Anyway, those Halves of theirs don't even exist!
6192355001583909 Fine. So why do you need a leash?
6192355001583908 Up the Tower. I mean, down the Tower. I mean, forget it. I misspoke.
6192355001583913 And the leashes are, of course, taken from lifeless bodies of your foes.
6192355001583914 You're a tough bunch.
6192355001583912 I'm almost a hound. All I need is one more leash. It's a test… to show how many Soul-and-a-Halves I've defeated. Get it? Battlefield glory!
6192355001583916 You commander isn't in the Polyhedron. He's over there. Is that fine?
6192355001583917 You're a downright saint.
6192355001583918 Sounds more like a tracker than a hound.
6192355001594816 But your leader is dead…
6192355001583915 It's not like we tear off fingers! They got crates of leashes in the Warehouses, and make more. Chara takes one from Gray every week.\nPlus, we don't <i>have</i> to take them by force. Diplomacy and deception are also viable options.
6192355001583920 Akela never misses, huh?
6192355001583921 Loyalty is commendable.
6192355001583919 Makes it even easier to deliver the loot. He's the leader, anyway.
6192355001594818 I'm sorry.
6192355001594817 Yeah…\nBut the Tower still stands. Ishka is in charge now.
6192355001594820 That's a different gang of children, isn't it?
6192355001594821 I'm not interested in your games.
6192355001594819 诺克金's Soul-and-a-Halves. How in the world did you miss them? They ramble about you all the time…
6192355001594824 What a horrible turn of events.
6192355001594826 I don't play your games.
6192355001594823 Welp, then you won't have it in the future, either.\nGuess you missed your chance to befriend the Soul-and-a-Halves, doctor. Now you won't be able to betray them and switch to my side.\nWhat a goof! Forget it. I'll look elsewhere.

6192354999754292 脑子正常的人都不会去喝高洪河的水，更不会去挖井，这是显而易见的常识。 干净的饮用水虽谈不上奢侈，但也非常珍贵。 它们来自大草原，人们往往靠味道就能判断这是来自哪一个泉的水。

6192354999754065 核桃
6192354999754066 While nuts can be munched down, they do little to sate hunger. Why then do the local kids' eyes light up when they see one?
6192354999754067 Used in the most popular game among local children, nuts are forbidden in the Polyhedron, where most of the kids fled from the plague. The "voices of nuts" were said to make the facets of the Polyhedron resonate in a bad way.
6192354999950067 一些核桃
6192354999950068 Can be munched down—with little effect. The kids here would sell their souls for a handful.

6192354999754281 Empty Flask
6192354999754282 An empty flask made of thick glass.

6192354999754072 While chestnuts are nuts, they're unedible without cooking. The local children still take a keen interest in them. 
6192354999754073 Despite the lack of chestnut trees around, chestnuts are omnipresent in the town. Where do they come from?

6192354999754125 The steppe people bury the remains of their dead in small packages. This is hardly one of them, but you'd rather not check.
6192354999754126 Long before the current socioeconomic catastrophe, the local townsfolk developed a tradition of barter that the whole community revelled in. Including many types, such as "tit for tat" and "retrab", it is sometimes secret, with people swapping wrapped items blindly.
6192354999947624 包裹
6192354999947625 Contains unknown useful items. Unfold to extract them.

6192354999754093 Protective headwear. Replaces all smells with that of the healing herbs placed in the beak. 
6192354999754094 The mask of Muu Shubuun, "the wicked bird"; part of the Reaper costume from the local theatre. Impossible to see through, it's actually mounted above an actor's head, making them peek through a hole in the cloak.

6192354999754109 Bandage
6192354999754110 Common bandages stop bleeding or can be fashioned into a makeshift noose if you've contracted the sand plague.
6192354999754111 It is common folk knowledge that any affliction can be overcome with the application of bandage and that any decently soft and clean cloth can serve as one. Makes one wonder how the people with such advanced medical knowledge even get sick at all.
6192354999936895 Bandage
6192354999936896 Improves health. Stop bleeding, and you stop death—or delay it, at least.

6192354999754056 Canned Food
6192354999754057 The can is completely airproof, guaranteeing that its contents are uninfected. The food itself is nutritious.
6192354999754058 Nutritious, neatly-packed and well-preserved food that somehow doesn't require a can opener. There's no manufacturer brand on the can and it's far from obvious what type of food is inside.
6192354999938360 Canned Food
6192354999938361 Filling, although I'm not sure what kind of food is inside.
6192354999938362 Before I returned to the Town, I grabbed a whole sack of canned food. Survived on it for almost a week. I can hardly stand the smell now.
6192355001377755 
6192354999754133 Candle Stub
6192354999754134 The stub of a nupital candle. It smells of earth.
6192354999754135 伊娃 Yan, the mistress of the Stillwater, often burned candles in the study during the night, which gave her observatory-like mansion a cozier appearance. After 伊娃's tragic suicide, candles can no longer be lit in the Stillwater and go out immediately.
6192354999938363 Candle Stub
6192354999938364 The stub of a nuptial candle. It smells of Earth.
6192354999938365 They say when Wild 妮娜 凯恩娜, the Dark Mistress of our town, so much as glanced at candles, they'd bow to her—even without wind.

6192354999754268 A human 肾脏.
6192354999754270 According to the steppe beliefs, the body is a perfect representation of the Universe. However, the steppe people are not so naive as to correlate organs and bones to cosmic or geographical features. What they refer to are, first and foremost, connections and circulations.

6192354999754077 Cracker
6192354999754078 Soldier food. There's no reason to prefer it to freshly baked bread.
6192354999754079 Leaving bread to go stale or dry is heavily frowned upon. Crackers arrived to the town with soldiers' rations and remain unpopular despite being decently filling.
6192354999939965 Toast
6192354999939966 Soldier food. It's better to eat fresh bread.
6192354999939967 Stale bread is bad news. It doesn't breathe.

6192354999754053 Money
6192354999754054 On the third day of the epidemic local prices went through the roof; now, on the eighth day, very few people agree to actually trade for money, preferring barter instead. The latter is more cumbersome, but can yield lucrative rewards.
6192354999754055 Oddly enough, money is used to buy items in shops. Offering it during common street barter, however, would be seen as offensive.\n
6192354999939962 Money

6192354999952061 Plaguefinder
6192354999952062 A mysterious device that allows me to better see signs of sand pest.
6192354999952063 Disregard the how; <i>why</i> was this made at all? And by whom?
6192355001377967 
6192354999754101 Leather Gloves
6192354999754102 Protective handwear. The local leatherworks are a less-known branch of Fat 维拉德's Bull Project.
6192354999754103 Leather gloves are still associated with the desire not to leave fingerprints, which is, to say the least, shady. A small price to pay when dealing with something extremely unpleasant to the touch.
6192354999947554 Leather Gloves
6192354999947555 Protective handwear. Perfect for opening unsafe drawers and doors.
6192354999947556 The Factory recently began training tawers. When flesh fails, the owner of the Bull Enterprise, Fat 维拉德, squeezes profit out of hide, too.
6192355001377796 
6192354999754142 Powder
6192354999754143 The box seems to be filled with powder made of assorted ground pills. It's hard to picture a person who would produce such a mixture.
6192354999754144 Powders, or "shmowders", as the kids call them, can sometimes cure any disease completely. Or at least they used to; 可汗, the children's leader who now rules the Polyhedron, claims that all the real "shmowders" were used up long before the epidemic.
6192354999947636 "Shmowder"
6192354999947637 A box filled with a yellowish powder. Guess it's for some kind of game.
6192354999947638 Smells like medicine. A dangerous idea for a game. Destroying this would be the responsible thing to do.

6192354999754130 Spindle
6192354999754131 It has almost run out of thread.
6192354999754132 One can hardly jab a finger with this thing on accident. However, a hand can probably be puctured through by it, if enough pressure is applied.
6192354999950060 Spindle
6192354999950061 It's almost out of thread.
6192354999950062 维多利亚 奥吉姆斯卡娅 used to spin. Only for show, of course. What's there to spin when your husband slaughters bulls instead of herding sheep?
6192355001377901 
6192354999753851 Panacea
6192354999754107 A run-of-the-mill medicine vial filled with clotty reddish liquid that vaguely smells of spices. It seems distantly familiar.
6192354999754108 Shortly before his tragic demise, 阿泰米 布拉克, a local pellar, claimed to have produced a miraculous cure capable of erasing the sand plague completely from one's body. Until now, his claims remained unproven. This may be the only sample in existence.

6192354999754261 A warm heart that went out to people. Literally.
6192354999754262 In the steppe lore, the center of mind and knowledge is the liver, while the center of feeling and emotion is the lower guts. They view the heart as a less crucial and rather mechanical organ that simply pumps life around, oddly arriving at a consensus with science-based medicine.
6192354999947566 Heart
6192354999947567 A hot, almost-beating heart.

6192354999754059 Bread
6192354999754060 Bread is the staff of life. No food is more filling.
6192354999754061 Anything that's baked of dough can be called bread. The local 老瓦iety is greyish in color and crumbly to the touch, making you doubt if it was actually made from grain. Surprisingly delicious though.
6192354999937669 Bread
6192354999937670 Bread is the heart of life. It's very filling.
6192354999937671 Never throw bread on the ground. If you're full, give it to a friend. No friends? Give it to an enemy. Hell, give it to a dog. Just don't waste it.

6192354999754276 A six-chambered military-grade revolver.
6192354999754277 The civil war has been going on for more than two years now. The hostility has mostly passed out hellhole by, but refugees and deserters keep bringing military-grade equipment to the furthest parts of the country.

6192354999754128 Long or short? Draw the short one!
6192354999754129 One must remember that which is most dear to them before the match burns out, or else the whole thing won't work.

6192354999754254 Fishing Hooks
6192354999754255 Sharp objects are regarded as dangerous and thus frowned upon by the locals.
6192354999754256 While the Gorkhon river has plenty of fish, fishing is for some reason unpopular among the locals. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that hooks are sharp objects, which are heavily frowned upon around here.
6192354999939987 Fishing Hooks
6192354999939988 Sharp objects are regarded as dangerous and thus frowned on by the locals.
6192354999939989 克拉拉 the deranged says that everyone has a hook to grab. But she's a manipulator. What everyone actually has is a knot to untie.

6192354999754083 Immune Boosters
6192354999754084 Assorted pills of unknown origin. Boost immunity. Side effects include nausea and the inability to smell almonds.
6192354999754085 Scientifically speaking, it is dubious whether immunity can be boosted at all. However, these pills work infallibly. According to the box, they were manufactured more than fifty years ago.

6192354999947573 Assorted pills of unknown origin. Boost immunity. Smell suspicious.
6192354999947574 Scientifically speaking, there's no consensus on if immunity can be boosted at all. However, these pills work well. According to the box, they were manufactured more than fifty years ago.

6192354999754287 Chalk
6192354999754288 A piece of chalk. Rough and unpleasant to the touch.
6192354999754289 The locals inexplicably detest chalk. Despite its eye-catching whiteness, it is considered unclean and is popularly associated with bad omens and doom. Chalk-marked train cars are washed with river water before they are unloaded.
6192354999938366 A piece of chalk. Used to draw lines.
6192354999938367 Chalk
6192354999938368 The world is one whole, having form only where it is divided. Some Lines are natural; others, man-made. Chalk, composed of the dead bodies of sea creatures, is a good tool for setting boundaries.

6192354999754145 Bull Bell
6192354999754146 Did it bring luck to the one who wore it?
6192354999754147 The inner surface of this bell is flecked with the sigils of the secret and sacred steppe alphabet. It is the knowledge of this alphabet that allowed 阿泰米 布拉克, a local pellar, to restore his rightful place in the steppe community—shortly before his tragic death.

6192354999936899 Did it bring luck to the one who wore it?
6192354999936900 This bell's inner surface is marked with sigils from the secret, sacred steppe alphabet. Like a human body, its insides mirror the universe.

6192354999754257 Marbles
6192354999754258 Children give them names, as though they were alive, and believe them to hold memories.
6192354999754259 No one knows how exactly marbles appear in the town. No one delivers or makes them. They simply pop up here and there; on the floor, under the pillow, or right on the ground.

6192354999754095 Executor Cloak
6192354999754096 Protective garment. The pendants serve no obvious purpose, yet it loses its protective qualities if stripped of them.
6192354999754097 Orderlies—the volunteer medical assistants—use the costumes borrowed from the local theatre as protective cloaks. This is the traditional costume of the Reaper, an allegory of Death.
6192354999939978 Executor Cloak
6192354999939979 Protects against infection during contact. The pendants serve no obvious purpose, but tearing them off would be a waste of time.

6192354999754086 Antibiotic
6192354999754087 The best way not to get infected is to be dead. Antibiotics, that lower infection at the price of general health. are the first step in that direction.
6192354999754088 "Bios" means life, which encompasses all that is living, including both the harmful bacteria and humans. Antibiotics attack both. The difference is that while they can kill a person dead, a couple of bacteria always escapes their assault, so it's impossible to cure yourself fully with antibiotics only.
6192354999947627 Different from my other medications. I need to test it on an infected person to see if it can cure the plague.
6192354999947628 Serum
6192354999947629 The liquid is thick and smells of soil. I brewed it from hot underground blood and a 酊剂.\n\n…Is this it?
6192355001237952 The only way to find out if this serum can cure the plague is to try it out.
6192354999754115 Key
6192354999754116 It's cold.

6192354999937657 Boots
6192354999937658 Secondhand boots, covered in reddish-black stains. Offer decent protection against contaminated air.
6192354999937659 Too low to traverse marshland, but they won't let you down otherwise. You can kick in doors and walk through trash without fear of blisters.
6192355001377798 
6192354999754148 Pocket Watch
6192354999754149 Recently stopped. This means that the owner has most likely died.
6192354999754150 TIme doesn't seem to be working properly in the town; there's no other explanation to the fact that 乔尔基 凯恩, the Judge, is two times younger than his twin brother. The 凯恩s' fascination with all things clockwork must have something to do with this.
6192354999947633 Pocket Watch
6192354999947634 Recently stopped. That means that the owner most likely died.
6192354999947635 维克多凯恩 never carries a watch around, but always knows the correct time, down to the second. We've tested him. Can he tell by the stars?

6192354999754121 Beetle
6192354999754122 A surprising, if useless, find in autumn.
6192354999754123 Some fifteen years ago, the Soul-and-a-Halves, the gang of children who are defined by sharing special bonds with their pets, actually considered to allow flower chafers as their "Halves" due to the beeltes "looking as though they knew something". The idea was quickly abandoned as ridiculous.
6192354999938357 Beetle
6192354999938358 A surprising find in autumn, if not useless.
6192354999938359 Where do they go in winter?
6192355001377908 
6192354999754112 Tourniquet
6192354999754113 Used to repair health. Rubber tourniquets are regarded as poor-quality by the towsfolk, who prefer the locally-made leather ones.
6192354999754114 The rumor that 布洛克将军, the chief commanding 士官 of the soldiers deployed to the town, hanged himself on a noose made of tourniquets rather than succumb to the disease, is absurd and unfounded. This rubber band can't support the weight of a grown man.
6192354999950064 Tourniquet
6192354999950065 Used to improve health. The townsfolk prefer locally made leather tourniquets over rubber ones.
6192354999950066 亚历山大·萨普洛夫 hoped to outlaw tourniquets in a desperate attempt to protect his 卡特琳娜 from morphine addiction. What a silly idea. One can't just outlaw bands made out of rubber and leather.
6192355001377787 
6192354999754062 Milk
6192354999754063 Oddly warm and creamy, as though milked minutes ago, this common nourishing drink can often be found as an offering at cemeteries.
6192354999754064 Often used an an offering to the dead, milk serves as a reminder that all that is born must come to an end. It's so popular in the town that cream separators can be found even in the households that seemingly have nothing to do with the local Bull Project.
6192354999947614 Milk
6192354999947615 Warm, creamy. Satisfies hunger and thirst. Reminds me of childhood.
6192354999947616 Often used an an offering to the dead, milk serves as a reminder that all that is born must come to an end. It is said that the dead drink milk over water because the flow of water reminds them of the flow of time.

6192354999754279 Revolver ammo.

6192354999754098 Cothurni
6192354999754099 Protective footwear. Rising above your troubles (and the plague-soaked ground) is as simple as wearing these theatrical shoes.
6192354999754100 Cothurni—unusual footwear that elevates the wearer hight above the ground—are popular with the local theatre. It is likely that the orderlies owe their awe-inspiring height to them.
6192354999939981 Cothurni
6192354999939982 Protective footwear. Helps one rise above their troubles—and the poisoned earth.
6192354999939983 This is theatrical footwear, worn by actors. It's likely the orderlies owe their awe-inspiring height to them.
6192355001377799 
6192354999754251 Broken Scissors
6192354999754252 The Moerae must have been in a hurry—too many threads to cut these days.
6192354999754253 It is said that 克拉拉 the 换生灵, a thief girl who claims to be a saint, can repair any sharp object just as easily as she cures the sand pest—by simply laying her hands on it. Perhaps this is the reason why people refuse to throw away useless junk like broken scissors.

6192354999754284 Blood-filled Flask
6192354999754285 A blood-filled flask.
6192354999754286 At a low temperature liquid blood can be preserved for up to three weeks, with enough red cells surviving. At a different temperature blood needs to be transfused within an hour. Blood used for tests remains usable for a day. 
6192354999939990 Blood
6192354999939991 A blood-filled flask.
6192354999939992 Blood is one of the primal elements. It bears life and death. Blood is compulsory.
6192355001377821 
6192354999754080 Water Bottle
6192354999754081 Seemingly sates hunger a bit. Despite the town standing on the river Gorkhon, fresh drinking water is a rare commodity here.
6192354999754082 Fresh water is brought to the town daily from a spring in the steppe and distributed among the households by water-bearers. The Gorkhon water was proven to be clean, but the locals refuse to drink it.
6192354999950070 Water Bottle
6192354999950071 Quenches thirst. Serves as a base for 酊剂s. Water from the Gorkhon river is undrinkable.
6192354999950072 Fresh water is carried into the Town daily from steppe springs, then distributed by water bearers. The Gorkhon water has long been poisoned by the Factory pollution. It's dangerous to even touch.
6192355001377760 
6192354999754136 Used Bandage
6192354999754137 The traces of the epidemic are omnipresent.
6192354999754138 According to the sanitary procedures, any object that bears the traces of a deceased person's blood must be burned. According to the local belief, it's pointless since the blood would simply appear elsewhere.
6192354999937654 Bloody Bandage
6192354999937655 This is a dead item. Someone created it by using a bandage.
6192354999937656 According to sanitary procedures, any object that bears the trace of a deceased person's blood must be burned. According to local belief, it's pointless since the blood will simply appear elsewhere.
6192355001377910 
6192354999754074 Raisins
6192354999754075 Formerly juicy berries, currently a luxurious treat that leaves one's mouth sugary when eaten.
6192354999754076 A luxurious imported treat. The locals refuse to eat more than a couple at a time; perhaps this has to do with the fact that raisins do not spoil and thus become the only treat available during food shortages.
6192354999947639 Raisins
6192354999947640 Once a juicy grape, now a small sweet that wouldn't satisfy an infant.
6192354999947641 If a train is late, first we run out of cookies, then chocolate, then candy. Only after that do children remember raisins.
6192355001377761 
6192354999754139 Broken Ampoule
6192354999754140 People would use any and all means possible to cure themselves of the disease.
6192354999754141 An ampoule that used to contain either life-saving or life-ending drug, served its purpose (whatever it was), and has now become completely useless.
6192354999938351 Broken Ampoule
6192354999938352 This is a dead item. The carcass of an ampoule of morphine.
6192354999938353 Items used to improve health die. Who could possibly want this?
6192355001377911 
6192354999754263 Liver
6192354999754264 Cutting open any bodies, including human, is taboo in our town. According to the "Baur Meges" steppe myth, the wholeness, harmony, and finiteness of the body are sacred. Only a person who possesses knowledge has the caste right to break this wholeness. Such people are allowed to work as doctors, butchers, or tattoo makers.
6192354999754265 A human liver.
6192354999947596 Liver
6192354999947597 A human liver.
6192354999947598 A body is not to be cut open. It's only allowed for menkhu—wise men who know where a body <i>wants</i> to give—and butchers, who accept sin. The word for butcher, "yargachin," also means "surgeon."
6192355001377822 
6192354999754118 Lockpick
6192354999754119 Twisted an uneven, the local lockpicks require a fast, jabbing motion to unlock a door, else they'll become uncoiled.
6192354999754120 It is said that 克拉拉 the 换生灵, a thief girl who claims to be blessed, can open any door just as easily as she heals the sick, by laying on hands. Why are her pockets always filled with lockpicks then?
6192354999950054 Lockpick
6192354999950055 I can either cut someone with it, or use it to pick a door lock. Either way it will break after a couple of uses.
6192354999950056 It is taboo to cut flesh in the Town, but crafty people know how to bend the rules. These <i>lockpicks</i> can produce unbearably painful wounds. Perhaps breaking and entering is more ethical.
6192355001377931 
6192354999754104 Face Mask
6192354999754105 A basic protective item that covers the face.
6192354999754106 Common among medical personnel, this protective mask accumulates infection fast, quickly becoming a hazard in and of itself, and muffles speech. Still, better than nothing.
6192354999947602 Gauze Mask
6192354999947603 Protects against disease clouds. Made from sterile gauze.
6192354999947604 At school, we threw these masks out after one use, since they absorb infection. In the Town, masks are fixed up, boiled, and reused.

6192354999937652 A blood-filled flask.

6192354999936890 Protects the respiratory tract from lethal gas. In comparison, disease clouds are nothing.

6192354999936893 Protects against infection during contact, like when opening drawers. Of exceptional quality.
6192354999936894 One can't help but wonder how many triggers these gloves have pulled.

6192354999939969 Worn and unimpressive.
6192354999939970 It's forbidden for 草药新娘s to have footwear: it's believed they speak with Earth through their rhythmic footsteps. Winter must get cold…

6192355000451553 
6192355000451554 A 酊剂 reveals some symptoms of the disease, showing which of the three Layers is damaged. But if a patient is administered too many 酊剂s, the pain can kill them.

6192354999936872 Not too fresh, but still able to satisfy a little hunger and thirst.
6192354999936884 苹果
6192354999936885 Each seed might one day become a tree, its roots permeating Earth.
6192355001377762 
6192354999939954 咖啡
6192354999939955 Coffee beans will immediately energize you, but it's very unhealthy.
6192354999939956 You can forego sleep with coffee—for a week or more, if need be, but it's a bad idea. Whoever refuses dreams dares fate to pass them over.
6192355001377763 
6192354999939971 鸡蛋
6192354999939972 Nothing like a good egg. Delicious. The chicken has yet to be seen.
6192354999939973 People mostly eat unfertilized eggs. This is an empty illusion of possible life.
6192355001377764 
6192354999947551 Fish
6192354999947552 Fresh fish. Filling, but it makes your throat feel dry.
6192354999947553 The lateral line is called that for a reason: every fish sees its Line unfold in a stream of possibilities. Sometimes, that Line is a fishing line.
6192355001377765 
6192354999947569 Smoked Fish
6192354999947570 Salty. Spicy. Smells delicious, never spoils, and causes ravaging thirst.
6192354999947571 Once, we tried to tease 劳拉 by calling her "Proud Trout." Instead of becoming offended, she said she respects fish for their calm and focus.
6192355001377766 
6192354999947593 Kashk
6192354999947594 A dry, fermented dairy product. Salty.
6192354999947595 While herding cows and bulls in the steppe, odonghs often live on water and kashk for months at a time. Nothing fancy, but it's nourishing.
6192355001377767 
6192354999947590 Lemon
6192354999947591 Eating a lot of lemons is bad for your teeth. They won't make you less hungry, but they're certainly an invigorating fruit.
6192354999947592 When life gives you lemons…
6192355001377768 
6192354999947608 Fresh Meat
6192354999947609 Every path in the world leads to meat. Nothing is more filling.
6192354999947610 The human world is a world of meat. The spirit is nothing more than twitching, trembling meat. Whoever denies meat will become extinct.
6192355001377769 
6192354999947611 Not as good as fresh meat, but better preserved. Tear it apart with your teeth; no forks or knives required.
6192354999947612 Smoked Meat
6192354999947613 Canned meat. Jerked meat. Smoked meat. Boiled meat. Beef, ham. The art of cooking meat is truly honored in the Town.
6192355001377770 
6192354999947630 Pemmican
6192354999947631 A mixture of meat, fruit, and fat. Extremely filling, only slightly revolting.
6192354999947632 Pemmican isn't eaten for pleasure. This form preserves meat and fat, so that's how odonghs prepare it before venturing into the steppe for weeks to herd bulls.
6192355001377771 
6192355000336084 Tan
6192355000336085 A tasty dairy drink. Satisfies hunger, quenches thirst.
6192355000336086 The Kin once told me the best tan is made during thunderstorms, or by swearing at the milk as harsh as you can. I tried every cuss in the book, but I never learned the art very well.
6192355001377772 
6192354999936882 Averts bad fortune. Unhelpful to me, but some people value it.
6192354999936883 You can't bring about good fortune—but you can craft it, like this handwoven charm. I suppose I could trade it for something.
6192355000584076 Charm
6192355001377912 
6192354999937660 Bracelet
6192354999937661 Worn to cut off the flow of warmth between the heart and the ring finger. Too small for me.
6192354999937662 A human body is the sum of its circulation. But it often needs to be interrupted for certain medical procedures.
6192355001377913 
6192354999939960 Invaluable if one needs to fix a gun or a relatively complex contraption.
6192354999939961 大维拉德's factories are some of the only stable workplaces in the Town. Unfortunately, he keenly remembers that 'stable' has several meanings.
6192355000511851 Metal Scrap
6192355001377914 
6192354999947557 Grindstone
6192354999947558 Used to sharpen knives, scissors... and scalpels.
6192354999947559 Sharp objects are frowned upon, for they are capable of disrupting the sacred wholeness of the body. But you can't cut bread with tradition, so people end up breaking the rule.
6192355001377915 
6192354999947575 Chisel
6192354999947576 Used to mark and sharpen tools. Handy when fixing bladed weapons and simple machinery.
6192354999947577 Rumor has it, Georgy 凯恩 carved the statue in the Crucible's yard with his own hands. Drivel. Why would a Judge waste his time on that?
6192355001377916 
6192354999947617 Needle
6192354999947618 As piercing as a wise person's stare. Can be used to pick small locks, such as the ones in cabinet drawers.
6192354999947619 They say that when 劳拉 拉薇尔 pricked her finger with a needle, no blood was drawn, and she hasn't ever fallen asleep ever since.
6192355001377917 
6192354999947645 Ring
6192354999947646 It circles back, like time. Equally precious.
6192354999947647 "Ding-a-ding,\nHear the ring ring…"
6192355001377918 
6192354999947648 Safety Pin
6192354999947649 Both safe and unsafe at the same time.
6192354999947650 穆克 the orphan says that safety pins are like people: open or closed, they always have a pointy end.
6192355001377919 
6192354999950057 Soap
6192354999950058 A bar of common soap.
6192354999950059 Nothing fancy, but soap is the best way to maintain hygiene. Essential.
6192355001377920 
6192354999950073 Spring
6192354999950074 A rusty metal spring. Useful to fix all kinds of tools.
6192354999950075 Industrialization granted the local workers new rights and fixed working hours. All it asked in return was their free will.
6192355001377921 
6192354999950076 Thimble
6192354999950077 Useless in a town that forbids sharp objects. Still good for sewing.
6192354999950078 Young ladies of good upbringing are often taught embroidery. But young 卡佩拉 never uses a thimble. A Mistress must sense a needle's path; if she doesn't, she deserves the consequences.
6192355001377922 
6192354999952051 Thread
6192354999952052 Ties that which is torn; fates, if it's red.
6192354999952053 Serious surgery requires thread, but in the field there's often no time to sew together wounds. Bandages and tourniquets have to do.
6192355001377923 
6192354999952057 Tweezers
6192354999952058 Useful to repair delicate equipment.
6192354999952059 Some kids sort their stamp collections with these; others tear wings off bugs.
6192355001377893 
6192355000131553 Rumor has it, sand pest can also be transmitted through word and thought. Bullshit… It has to be bullshit.
6192355000131554 脑组织的一部分。 Crossed with defects.
6192355000131555 Infected Brain
6192355001377872 
6192354999947563 Infected Heart
6192354999947564 Ulcerous, yet still almost alive.
6192354999947565 "Every object has a heartbeat. Can't you hear it?"
6192355001377873 
6192354999936877 Common rifle ammo.
6192354999936878 The local children call this pointed ammo "beakers." They often carry a couple in their pockets.
6192355001377751 
6192355001630655 Rifle Ammo
6192354999936879 Shotgun Ammo
6192354999936880 Common shotgun ammo.
6192354999936881 Perfect for putting on railroad tracks. 斯塔克, 格拉薇尔, 格里夫, and I would do it all the time as kids. Trains were more common back then.
6192355001377752 
6192354999939996 Forceps
6192354999939997 A medical tool for operating on soft tissue—for example, in the chest.
6192354999939998 Progress is unstoppable. Even in this remote place, operating with dedicated tools is better.
6192355001377894 
6192354999952054 Trepanner
6192354999952055 Use to crack the skull for an operation or autopsy.
6192354999952056 This crude tool is frowned upon by some judgmental types. But they don't have to deal with the real epidemics, do they?
6192355001377895 
6192354999947587 Leash
6192354999947588 Made of sturdy leather. Whoever gets leashed won't get away. Kids value it.
6192354999947589 All Soul-and-a-Halves have a leash. I think they represent humility towards their animal Halves. But what would a Doghead do with one?

6192355000046151 手术刀
6192355000046152 Either a weapon that can take someone's life, or a tool to extract organs.
6192355000046153 In our town, it is forbidden to deny the sacred wholeness of a body by cutting it open. Only a certain caste of people, menkhu, are allowed to do that. My 父亲 is one, though. The rest follows.

6192355000171751 刀
6192355000171752 Too rough for medical procedures. Too dirty for cutlery. Only good for taking lives.
6192355000171753 Murder is a sin worse than digging wells in our town. Not because the soul is considered sacred, but because the body is. What is not whole, is not holy. A torn body is a foul mockery of the universe.

6192355000332652 Can be munched down—with little effect. The kids here would sell their souls for a handful.
6192355000332653 The game goes like this: find a nut that has t拉薇尔ed far, guess its name, shake it, and listen to stories from the soul trapped inside.\n\nThis originated with the Polyhedron. We didn't play it as kids.
6192355001377773 
6192355000334060 Rusty Key
6192355000334061 Unlocks an abandoned room in the Factory. A useful find, since I'm now homeless…
6192355001377955 
6192355001377956 
6192355000303851 名单
6192355000303852 A list of names. The handwriting is clearly 父亲's. I need to touch this to read it.
6192355000303853 1. 史迪奇\n2. 卡佩拉\n3. 穆克\n4. 诺克金\n5. 可汗\n6. 格蕾丝\n7. 塔雅 泰吉\n8. [不熟悉的大草原印记]
6192355001377958 
6192355001377951 家门钥匙
6192355001377952 I could draw its pattern with my eyes closed.
6192355001377953 坏格里夫 would climb in through the window. 斯塔克, he preferred to stay outside. Only 劳拉 would knock on the door—and so politely, too.
6192355001377954 
6192355000371151 Rusty Key
6192355000371152 And a note. Signed "V. O." To read it, I need to touch it.
6192355000371153 "I've found a spare key, but these key thefts (?) are becoming concerning. Your equipment is far from cheap, is it not? It would serve no one if it gets stolen.\n\nAnd do keep in mind that if our small arrangement is uncovered, I too will have to bear the consequences.\n\n-V. O."
6192355001377959 
6192355000334057 Morphine
6192355000334058 Relieves fear and pain, leaving you drowsy and numb. If I take this before sleep, I'll recuperate better.
6192355000334059 A person is only alive for as long as they feel pain. No matter what 卡特琳娜 萨普洛娃 does, she remains alive.
6192355001377788 
6192355000334054 When a person is done with their name, they discard it.
6192355000334055 Scrap Name
6192355000334056 People in this town are like a flight of birds, and birds don't require names. Individuality is overrated.
6192355001377924 
6192355000334051 Straight Razor
6192355000334052 Too wonky to be used as a weapon or surgical instrument, but kids love it.
6192355000334053 Ten years ago, local bandits used to call themselves "barbers" and brandish a particular style of razors as a mark of their identity. I wonder what became of that culture.

6192355001185757 Precise. Long-range. Deadly.
6192355001185758 I've held such a rifle in my hands only once before. I'd prefer to not think about that day.
6192355001377933 
6192355000861262 ???
6192355000861263 A potion with unknown properties. Made from infected blood. I must test it on a patient.
6192355000861264 This potion was made from infected flesh. By adding active compounds to a bacterial culture, I've prepared a medicine that should suppress the infection. Now it's time to put theory into practice.

6192355001377856 A mixture of herbs and human organs is called "dead broth." It is believed to absorb death and feebleness, invigorating whoever takes it.\n\nMy handcrafted 止痛药s have a hidden property: they divert the plague's gaze. If I see the world going dark due to infection, taking one will relieve the effect.

6192355000620451 牛血
6192355000620452 Useless for crafting. Show this to 丹考夫斯基?
6192355001254454 Bulls don't get sand pest. 为什么？\n\nAlthough, to be honest, I care much less about the <i>why</i> then about the <i>how.</i> How can I use it, if at all? A puzzle that can only be solved with a microscope.

6192355001173251 It's hard to tell under all the covers, but it's a living baby. It should be brought to the 城镇大厅.
6192355001173252 Baby
6192355001173253 It feels strange to carry a baby like an item, but now isn't the time to be sentimental.
6192355001173254 
6192355000450352 Rusty 手术刀
6192355000450353 Either a weapon that can take someone's life, or an essential tool for 一个外科医生。 Shame it's so shoddy.
6192355000450354 A tool for 一个外科医生。 A tool for a menkhu. A tool for a bandit. A tool for a ripper. A tool for me.\n\nThis tool would easily damage an internal organ during an autopsy.
6192355001377934 
6192355000450355 Bloody Lockpick
6192355000450356 It clearly got inside 匹斯沃克's gut unnaturally. I doubt anyone would want to trade for this thing; but I can use it.
6192355000450357 匹斯沃克 might have deserved it, but doctors are like soldiers: we don't get to choose who we save… Do we?
6192355001377970 
6192355000482251 Infected Blood
6192355000482252 Can be used like any other infected organ.
6192355001377874 Among the Layers of the body, Blood is often mentioned; at other times, Flesh; but rarely both as two separate Layers. Blood <i>is</i> flesh. "We are of the same blood, you and I." "You are flesh of our flesh."

6192355001377879 
6192355000525552 Army Ration
6192355000767251 Filling. Soldiers take these to the front so that their death comes from a bullet rather than starvation.
6192355000767252 布洛克将军 never wanted to come to this town, but it's a soldier's duty to follow orders… Isn't it?
6192355001377774 
6192355000525551 Twyrine
6192355000767267 An herbal infusion. Drink to reveal events and places hidden from the naked eye.
6192355000767268 The Town calls to me. But it's hard to hear over my own thoughts. If I quiet them down, I can sense the pulse of life all over the Town.

6192355001237951 Hot blood from the udurgh's Ear. A single drink replenishes you and restores health. But that's not why I need it.
6192355001377971 
6192355000767256 Candy Wrapper
6192355000767257 A colorful piece of paper. Useless.
6192355000767258 A blurry blue spot in the corner could either be an official seal, or a trace of dissolved candy.
6192355001377926 
6192355001040752 Lancet
6192355001377935 A surgeon's tool of stellar quality. Good at murder, too.
6192355001377936 A tool for 一个外科医生。 A tool for a menkhu. A tool for a bandit. A tool for a ripper. A tool for me.\n\nThis tool was made specifically for surgeons, so it's perfect for autopsies.
6192355001377937 
6192355001377938 Menkhu's Finger
6192355001377939 Trace it along flesh, pry it open. To kill, to cure—is there any difference?
6192355001377940 A tool for 一个外科医生。 A tool for a menkhu. A tool for a bandit. A tool for a ripper. A tool for me.\n\nThis is a ritual 手术刀 that only the menkhu can touch. If a layman were to try it, it is said the 手术刀 will turn against their own flesh. But in capable hands, this is the best 手术刀 available.

6192355000767260 Why did I collect this?
6192355001377777 
6192355000767261 Button
6192355000767262 A trifle to a human, but a whole eye to a doll.
6192355000767263 穆克 is said to have a doll, but no one's ever seen it. Perhaps it simply lives all over the Town?
6192355001377927 
6192355000767264 Cotton Wool
6192355000767265 Looks like stuffing of some sort.
6192355000767266 In the wide world, a surgeon's best friend, but back here, people take surgery less seriously, and disinfectant is mostly taken by mouth.

6192355001630724 An incredibly rare concoction made of twyre berries. When consumed, it reveals several points of interest in the Town.
6192355001630725 Twyre berries are rarely picked. Few people ever see this potion. Perhaps fate is thanking me for lending someone assistance in the past?

6192355001557252 "We're gone, but our caches stay! We asked jerboas. It's their game now. The jerboas introduced their own rules too. \n\nNyuta and Sleepy Head left shmowders in their Caches. You'd better find and take them, else the jerboas will eat them. Maybe they already have. And shmowders are bad for them!"

6192354999952452 布拉克?你指的是伊西多?
6192354999952453 Have you seen much death?
6192355000339751 I don't think you recognized me. I'm a 布拉克.
6192354999952451 Seems the 布拉克 prophecy is true, huh? Each 布拉克 will spill a river of blood. Or drown the Town in blood, maybe—the wording varies. So it goes. So much death…
6192354999952455 Bullshit. Old wives' tales.
6192354999952458 伊西多 has nothing to do with this. This is on you.
6192354999952454 Of course. He may not have spilled it himself, but it's all happening because of him. Just as the prophecy foretold.
6192354999952457 Perhaps it is the end.
6192354999952459 None of this is my fault.
6192354999952456 Yes. We've never suffered this before—no, certainly not like this. Mark my words: the end is nigh. The Wormwood star rises in the night sky.
6192354999952461 A shabnak-adyg is a myth! It's not real.
6192354999952462 You're chasing steppe demons, huh? A little seasonal lapse of sanity?
6192354999952463 Here's my method: If it doesn't have any brains, that means its head is made of clay. Take it right to the cemetery.
6192354999952460 A shabnak-adyg always steals the form of a woman, but that's mere illusion, broken the moment it starts to run. That's when you notice the legs, made of bone or clay. It leaves no trace behind. When it runs, the illusion dissolves, like a smell carried away on the wind.
6192354999952467 I'm a local.
6192354999952466 You must be an outsider. If you'd lived here as long as I have, you'd sing a different tune. \nHere, the Earth is alive. It bears more than just crops. Sometimes, it spits out a horror so unfathomable, you spend the whole night sleeping in fits and starts. Clay and bones cultivate a beast. People don't kill other people around here—only a shabnak would do that.
6192354999952469 I was making fun of you, idiot.
6192354999952470 Then off to the cemetery you go! Say hello to the ghosts for me.
6192354999952468 Right. The cemetery's where they come from. Lots of clay there, and bones.
6192354999952473 What stake?
6192354999952481 What trial?
6192354999952472 So… Are they all finished over by the Stake? Trial complete?
6192354999952483 Wait, where's that lot?
6192354999952484 Holy hell. Your parents ever teach you any manners?
6192354999952482 Did you hit your head somewhere, big guy? Or are you just stupid? They caught a man-eater at the Bone Stake Lot. A clay demon from the steppe! Look, I don't have time to catch up some random idiot.
6192354999952486 Got it. Maybe I'll take a look…
6192354999952487 Get out of here, kid, before I teach you some manners myself.
6192354999952485 What an idiot! I'd say you're an outsider, but you're dressed like a factory worker. That where you hit your head? The lot's in the Skinners.
6192354999952476 Do you know who started the rumor?
6192354999952477 Anything is possible. I've met people who only looked human on the outside—deep down, they were vile beasts.
6192354999952475 Agreed.
6192354999952474 Everyone's losing their minds. Hell, they'll start looking for ghosts and bogeymen soon. Shabnaks don't exist. It's just the damned twyre blooming, making our heads swim.
6192354999952479 I'm 阿泰米, 伊西多 布拉克之子. I have returned.
6192354999952480 Wrong, sister. You couldn't possibly know who I am.
6192354999952478 Who could ever figure that out now?\n…You know, I swear I recognize your face. 你是谁？
6192354999952491 I am.
6192354999952492 Why do you ask?
6192354999952490 Ah… So you are 布拉克's heir?
6192354999952494 What the hell?
6192354999952495 He's a complete stranger to me. And I don't need anyone to intercede on my behalf.
6192354999952498 No. I'm my own man. As is 奥吉姆斯基.
6192354999952493 You're one of 奥吉姆斯基's men now, right? 大 维拉德 said anyone who touches you will be in for a world of hurt.
6192354999952500 I'll stay on my toes.
6192354999952502 He wants to decide my fate behind my back? Good luck with that.
6192354999952499 It's unwise to get in his way. 牛老大 is a powerful patron. Don't let him down.
6192354999952504 Why are you all so angry? Have I wronged you in some way?
6192354999952506 I'm going, I'm going… Just calm down.
6192354999952503 Move along… or I'll scream!
6192354999952508 What protector? 你是谁 talking about?
6192354999952509 I only arrived several hours ago, woman.
6192354999952507 You're a cold-blooded murderer. You killed our protector. You're a walking clue, fella: bloody clothes, foreign face, and you stink like a railroad. Rumor has it, that's where the murderer hid.\nWere you trying to escape? Skip town?
6192354999952511 Why don't you, then? Go ahead.
6192354999952512 Shut up! Shut up, or <i>I'll</i> scream.
6192354999952510 You know who. Move along, I said! I have nothing to talk to you about! And stop glaring, I'm not afraid of you. I'll scream!
6192354999952952 You feel sorry for me? You're an angel.
6192354999952953 We who?
6192354999952951 You poor thing… We still think you're good.
6192354999952955 Likewise.
6192354999952959 You'll grow up into a good person.
6192354999952954 I do.
6192354999952957 That's like a whole army. So I'm not alone.
6192354999952958 Tell them… tell them I'm grateful.
6192354999952956 Well… Tata, Rubber, Filya, Tag, Cuckoo, Lelya, Ruffle… Also, Ruta and Tisha. And 卡佩拉 only said good things about you.
6192354999952961 Right, a kitten. Exactly what I need.
6192354999952962 I'm like a kitten myself. That's enough cats in my life.
6192354999952963 I'll think about it.
6192354999952960 Tata brought kittens yesterday. Six. Do you want a kitten?
6192355000153127 What Slicer House?
6192355000153128 Beshe. I haven't seen her.
6192355000153126 Kharaalai, I'm in trouble. 我的姐姐失踪了，你见过她吗？她脸上有四颗痣。我怕她死在Slicer House屋了。他们会把她一片片卖了... They'll sell her piece by piece now…
6192355000153131 我不认识他。
6192355000153132 我认识他。
6192355000153129 A bad place in the Town, behind the Guzzle. 老瓦 lives there, a chemist. He buys body parts—sells them, too. Many know, but none act.
6192355000153136 Who knows. You'll find her.
6192355000153137 Perhaps she was killed during the witch hunt.
6192355000153138 我想我应该去拜访一下Slicer House。或许有用...
6192355000153135 They say that we kill people and bring 老瓦 the guts. That's always been a lie. But now? I'm not sure… Where else could my sister be?
6192355000153140 What patrol?
6192355000153141 Not my kind of work. I'm too impatient.
6192355000153142 If you're in doubt, flip a coin.
6192355000153139 Have you been to the governor? About the patrols, I mean? The pay is good, but… too good, actually. Suspicious. What's going on with that?
6192355000153144 I guess they haven't caught the murderer yet. Perhaps they need people for a raid.
6192355000153145 So the governor's in the 城镇大厅? Got it.
6192355000153143 All strong men—who aren't cowards—should report to the 城镇大厅, it went. They might even announce an emergency situation. I wonder 为什么？ A revolt at the Factory, maybe? It's not working. Hear the silence?
6192355000153147 奥吉姆斯基 thinks I belong to him? Did I hear you right?
6192355000153148 I don't know anything. I don't work there.
6192355000153146 Fat 维拉德 said the 奥吉姆斯基 got you in their pocket. Tell me, then, the hell's going on at his Factory! Why'd it shut down? Will we still be paid?
6192355000153150 Oh, so he's got plans, that damn fat cat.
6192355000155051 I see. I'll have to take care of that, then.
6192355000155052 Exactly. So leave me alone.
6192355000153149 He said you're his protégé, that no one touch you. Means he has plans.
6192355000155054 …Turned into kindling?
6192355000155056 Damn it!
6192355000155053 Hey! We just paid respects to your 父亲 at the cemetery. You know if you don't go there within the hour, he's gonna get turned into kindling?
6192355000155058 Shut up. I'm on my way.
6192355000155059 Who would refuse…? No, don't tell me. I'll figure it out.
6192355000155057 They refuse to bury him. You didn't hear? I think it's blasphemy, myself.
6192355000155061 How does 格蕾丝 know?
6192355000155062 Who is 格蕾丝?
6192355000155060 格蕾丝 says Mom still hasn't forgiven me. It's been two years since she died, but the grudge lives on.
6192355000155064 You swear? I guess I should check.
6192355000155065 Seems someone needs to find a better place for the girl…
6192355000155063 She talks to the dead. I swear. She can press her ear to the ground, fall asleep, and wake up with news. It's a gift, 'cause she's nutso. Her dad was addicted to twyrine. Her mom, too, even while she carried 格蕾丝.
6192355000375652 Looks after the dead?
6192355000375653 Yeah. Twyrine is an evil concoction.
6192355000375651 The cemetery caretaker's daughter. She looks after the dead herself now, since twyrine did her dad in.
6192355000155068 Death has arrived there. That's why.
6192355000155069 Must be some sort of vapor…
6192355000155067 The air in the Hindquarters has turned foul. Heavy, viscous air… Some rift opened in the ground, maybe? I'm not sure.
6192355000155071 What Tower?
6192355000155072 Oh, all this is so very interesting.
6192355000155070 I need to talk to 可汗 at the Tower. Though, the Town is all abuzz now, makes me kinda reluctant to leave.
6192355000155074 可汗… I know the name. He's in the Tower?
6192355000155075 When was that thing even built? it wasn't here when I left.
6192355000155073 You blind, big fella? Just look over there. The Tower across the river… Our Polyhedron. The only place where life is real.
6192355000155077 I don't know. I think they will.
6192355000155078 Wait a second. What 塔雅? 塔雅 泰吉?
6192355000155076 Our 塔雅 is in the Termitary, isn't she? Why was it locked? Will they open it soon?
6192355000155080 It's cool, all right. Cool as heck. But I need to talk to her.
6192355000155081 It's a mouthful.
6192355000155079 塔雅 泰吉. But we call her the Mother Superior. Mother Superior! Isn't that cool as heck? It's 卡佩拉's idea!
6192355000155089 为什么？
6192355000155090 I'm sorry.
6192355000155088 My wife was killed yesterday. How can I look our children in the eyes now? I've lost the right to be called their 父亲.
6192355000155092 That's… kind of true.
6192355000155096 What could you have done?
6192355000155091 I promised her we'd share every joy, every woe. I promised to protect her. What use is that now? What use are words without action?!
6192355000155098 Stop whining.
6192355000155099 You know? This is true for me, too. I need to be bolder.
6192355000155100 What's done is done. Live on, pal. For the children.
6192355000155097 I could have been… assertive. Think faster when it went down. I could have acted quickly, efficiently, instead of staying in my head! If only…
6192355000155102 I'm an outsider. Why are you telling me this?
6192355000155103 Do you go there every night?
6192355000155101 See you tonight at 萨巴's place? It's dangerous, yes… This is <i>ngan-pa dgu-’dzoms,</i> a place you must not bring outsiders.\nEveryone's looking for a shabnak-adyg. It's good they forgot 萨巴.
6192355000155105 In that case, you can wait some more.
6192355000155109 Your meetings don't fit into my plans.
6192355000155110 Got it.
6192355000155104 You're Kin, Khatangher. 萨巴 talked about you a lot these days. We waited for you, yargachin.
6192355000155107 So will I.
6192355000155108 So, I'm Kin to you?
6192355000155106 The Kin can even live there. People come and go, yes.
6192355000237652 Do you know what an udurgh is? What does the 可汗dro sigil stand for?
6192355000237653 Poorly.
6192355000237651 How fares your kine, Khatangher?
6192355000237655 But what does that… mean?
6192355000237656 Everyone but me…
6192355000237654 A body that contains a world. Everyone knows that.
6192355000237658 You haven't made it more clear.
6192355000237659 I see.
6192355000237657 Be khara, it can be a creature made of many creatures. Like a family. A tagloor—a group of people bound by the same fate.
6192355000237661 Yes… Connections are like veins. You can't just tear them out.
6192355000237662 Khaya dee. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355000237660 Our words are erased, Khatangher. We turn our 父亲s' flutes into sticks. We take old words, big words, and apply them to small things. But the connection to the source is still there. The Lines remember.
6192355000375655 Here I am.
6192355000375656 How old are you?
6192355000375654 There you are.
6192355000375658 Keep growing, then. Don't slow down.
6192355000375659 Got anything interesting to say?
6192355000375657 Eight, soon. Five for now.
6192355000375661 I was on my way.
6192355000375662 Soon? 为什么？
6192355000375666 谁是卡佩拉?
6192355000375660 You need to see 卡佩拉. Soon, soon, soon.
6192355000375664 Short and to the point.
6192355000375665 I'd give you candy, but I'm all out…
6192355000375663 Because.
6192355000375668 Why do I need to see her?
6192355000375669 Sorry about your 父亲…
6192355000375667 Our mom. 大 维拉德's daughter—my dad works at his Factory, you know.
6192355000464452 Not yet.
6192355000464453 Why are you asking?
6192355000464451 Did you find 伊西多's killer yet?
6192355000464455 What?
6192355000464456 Caused the plague?
6192355000464457 Where's your proof?
6192355000464454 You realize the same people who killed him also caused the plague? He stood in their way once and stopped them. This time, they succeeded.
6192355000464459 This can't be…
6192355000464460 Who would do such a thing? 为什么？
6192355000464458 Oh, use your head! 伊西多 was killed—our only doctor. First murder in town for years! And what happens the very next day? An outbreak. You know, if a fire starts from four corners at once, smart folks call it arson.
6192355000464462 You're talking about the Kin?
6192355000464465 You're lying.
6192355000464461 Someone wants to eradicate the local population. Maybe even wipe the whole Town off the map. They don't even care if it takes them to their own grave—they can't live like this, so life is meaningless. \nNow… who has reason to hate the existing order of society? Use your head!
6192355000464464 You're just making shit up!
6192355000464466 Perhaps… Perhaps you're right.
6192355000464467 I need to think about it.
6192355000464463 This is a steppe disease, brought by the steppe people. That's where we should be looking. This plague, it didn't start out of nowhere. It was engineered, <i>directed</i> by someone. Ask anyone. It's not natural!
6192355000493176 I'm neither thief nor murderer, pal. You'd do well to remember that.
6192355000493189 What does conscience have to do with it?
6192355000493190 Pah! "Trust." You're superstitious. I remember this attitude growing up.
6192355000493175 I'd like to trade with you, for my conscience's sake. But no one will trade with thieves or murderers. Barter is about trust.
6192355000493192 Not about objects? Would you like to trade your coat for a match, then?
6192355000493195 Nothing sacred about it… It's just old.
6192355000493191 Barter is a sacred tradition. You understand that it's not about objects at all, don't you?
6192355000493194 There is no fate. We make our own lives.
6192355000493196 Don't worry. You won't.
6192355000493197 A clear conscience is important… but even if I have sinned, it's not contagious. So mind your own soul, pal.
6192355000493193 I might have accepted that offer. But I won't trade with a man who has a burdened conscience. Why poison my own fate?
6192355000493199 Fair enough. I guess I didn't think about it.
6192355000493200 Fine. I'll clear my good name soon. Then we can barter.
6192355000493201 Trust is about forgiving your enemies, and seeing the good in them.
6192355000493198 You're weird. <i>Your</i> fate won't improve my life, only my own trust. Get it? When I trust someone, I get lucky, so good things come my way.
6192355000493178 Poorly.
6192355000493202 Bayarlaa. How fares your kine?
6192355000493203 Finally! Someone who doesn't treat me like a villain.
6192355000493177 How fares your kine, Khatangher?
6192355000493205 How come?
6192355000493208 I'd rather lose standing.
6192355000493204 We, the Khatanghe, must help each other out. You are our Kin. \nYou shouldn't get into fights, tangher. You'll always lose, no matter who remains standing.
6192355000493207 Damned if you do, damned if you don't…
6192355000493209 But they don't treat each other that way!
6192355000493206 Think, tangher. If they kill you, then it's very bad, right? But if <i>you</i> kill <i>them,</i> it's still bad. Everyone will hate you. Won't let you in, sell you food, or barter. You'll be hunted. Do you need a wolf's life?
6192355000493211 I'm a halfbreed. I only have steppe blood on my 父亲's side.
6192355000493214 True. We are the Kin.
6192355000493215 I don't identify as one of you.
6192355000493210 We are the Kin. They dislike us.
6192355000493213 Sounds tempting.
6192355000493216 Bayarlaa. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355000493212 Don't get into fights, unente. Clear up your name first. As time passes, people will accept you. Then do as you please.
6192355000493180 Have you lost it? You see the屠宰场 over there? Guess where all its waste gets dumped.
6192355000493232 Gorkhon water will turn you into livestock. Saw it with my own eyes.
6192355000493179 So relieved they brought fresh water from the springs. Otherwise, we'd have to drink from the Gorkhon.
6192355000493234 What about water bearers? Have they left for more?
6192355000493235 It used to last for quite a while. Did something change?
6192355000493233 You have no sense of humor, tenegh. Who'd drink from the Gorkhon? Even blood would be better. So, fresh spring water is good news.\nBut I wonder how long it will last…
6192355000493237 为什么？
6192355000493241 Why do you think he's useless?
6192355000493236 Fat 维拉德 used to manage the water bearers. Now, it's his son.\nThe 父亲 is cruel, but he knows his business. The son is kinder, but useless. He'll certainly mess everything up.
6192355000493239 You're not cruel… Just bitter.
6192355000493240 True.
6192355000493238 What use are kind people? We aren't kind. We deserve no kindness.
6192355000493243 Indeed. I doubt anyone in this town would be that reckless.
6192355000493244 Just superstition. I also believed it, for a while, but not anymore.
6192355000493242 维拉德 the Younger manages the water bearers now, but he's a simpleton. I've even heard rumors he might be digging a well… \nSurely false, of course. Even someone completely incompetent wouldn't do that.
6192355000493182 But I like breathing.
6192355000493217 Nice poem. You write that yourself?
6192355000493181 One and two and one and two,\nSteppe has gotten into you.\nWho breathes air in the fall,\nDies before he sees it all.
6192355000493219 A bear, huh? Friends used to call me Cub when we were kids. But back then, it was ironic.
6192355000493223 I'm not one to turn down small favors.
6192355000493218 Guess a bear like you can breathe some and be fine. But only some.
6192355000493221 I'm a local. Just been away for a while.
6192355000493222 I just arrived.
6192355000493220 If only! I'll never be that good.\nWhen'd you last sleep? The circles around your eyes, the wheezing… Just observing facts. Are you an outsider?
6192355000493225 You're thinking of a stroke.
6192355000493226 No explosions, but our brains do get less oxygen in the fall around here.
6192355000493227 Your mom is right.
6192355000493228 She seems to be an expert on local herbs.
6192355000493224 Mom says that while twyre, chickenpox, crowberry, swish, and joy all bloom, you have to sleep every five hours. Or your head will explode!
6192355000493230 Yes. I'm a doctor.
6192355000493231 I'm 一个外科医生。 Ever considered having your tongue removed?
6192355000493229 Huh? Are you a doctor or something? I hate doctors. Mom says all doctors are slackers and frauds, even Old 布拉克.
6192355000493184 What train?
6192355000493245 No, I haven't heard anything.
6192355000493183 Hey, big fella… On your way here, did you hear anything? Like a train?
6192355000493247 Yeah, I'm a local. I already know all this.
6192355000493248 Does your dad work at the Factory? The skinnery or the cannery?
6192355000493246 Oh, an outsider. So! We send meat and skins to the outside world, and they send back a big ol' train of provisions, mostly stuff we can't make.\nDad says it's like living out at sea, on a faraway island.
6192355000493250 Hey! Aren't you too young to talk about that kind of stuff?
6192355000495156 Beats unemployment.
6192355000493249 Wha—? No, my dad's a postman! If he worked at the Factory, phew… I wouldn't be here at all! 'Cause mom would've had an abortion!
6192355000495152 Sure, the life of a factory worker isn't exactly blessed…
6192355000495157 And you walk around repeating it? Have some tact.
6192355000495151 为什么？ She says it herself when she sees Uncle Bertie.
6192355000495154 Two weeks? That's a long time, actually…
6192355000495155 Unbelievable, indeed. I'd keep my buttons.
6192355000495153 The train is already two weeks late. We might very well starve soon. Like, we've almost run out of sweets. Uta bartered away all her buttons for a lump of sugar yesterday! Unbelievable!
6192355000493186 Same as you, I believe.
6192355000495159 What do you mean, "still"? It will remain with me even as I die.
6192355000493185 Do you still have a name?
6192355000495161 Why did he do that?
6192355000495162 I bet it does!
6192355000495163 Cheer up. Faces and names are only fiction.
6192355000495160 父亲 threw his out. He's faceless, now. Makes me kinda sad.
6192355000495165 Or something good. That's how it usually goes.
6192355000495166 I don't think knowing would do you any good.
6192355000495164 Guess he did something bad… I wonder what.
6192355000495168 …And your face, yes? Cheer up. It'll be fine.
6192355000495171 Same here.
6192355000495167 But I'm curious. I would hate to lose my name.
6192355000495170 Of course. He understood something very important.
6192355000495172 You just… don't stop loving him.
6192355000495169 Really? Do you know for sure? 'Cause he can't tell now.
6192355000493188 Why can't you just ground them?
6192355000495173 So what? Fate will get you anywhere.
6192355000493187 A murderer walks the streets. Human or shabnak, who knows… But our kids are outside, too. Won't stay home no matter what we tell them!
6192355000495175 I didn't. Perhaps we have several.
6192355000495176 But they do.
6192355000495174 Fate! Why do I care if it's fate or not if illness befalls me? Who said each person only has one, single fate?
6192355000495178 You're sure there's nothing to be done?
6192355000495179 What does this have to do with the Tower?
6192355000495177 Everything's terrible… It all started with that awful tower. There's nothing we can do, now. Kids do whatever they damn well please. \nCan't say anything to them… I mean that. Try, and the words stick in your throat. They've become complete strangers to us. But what about common blood, I ask you? What about paternal love?
6192355000495185 Do you know who built it?
6192355000495189 How many children do you have?
6192355000495181 They'll return, and the ice will become thicker.
6192355000495180 Hard to explain… The Tower crushes us. Try to speak a word against it, and it's as if an invisible blade slices your vocal cords.\nIt did something to our kids. Like they're crossing a river over thin ice, and you can't follow, only call after them.
6192355000495183 What is it, anyway?
6192355000495184 Eh, it's natural. When I was a kid, I also preferred to be outside.
6192355000495182 Because they belong to that damned tower now.
6192355000495187 Oh… Makes sense now.
6192355000495188 Don't worry about the kids. They're smarter than us.
6192355000495186 The 凯恩s, of course, let the fires of hell take them. Who else? If only the 萨普洛夫s ruled this town by themselves, it'd be such a nice place…
6192355000495191 Let them play.
6192355000495192 Living in their own world could be good for them.
6192355000495193 Nothing a few lashes with a belt wouldn't fix.
6192355000495190 Me? Two younger brothers. Twelve and fifteen. Both in the Tower.
6192355000507345 Huh? You're doing something for me?
6192355001225979 You do that.
6192355001225984 What will be done?
6192355000507344 We're working, we're working! It'll be done soon. You'll like it.
6192355001225981 And who is "we"?
6192355001225980 So we will! We aren't suckers, and we <i>definitely</i> aren't cowards. Promise you that.
6192355001225983 I'd love to remember my childhood for a while and play with you kids. But I've got a different war on my hands.
6192355001225987 Why can't you urchins just stay home?
6192355001225982 Scouts.
6192355001225986 I don't like surprises.
6192355001225988 Best way to help me would be staying safe, so you don't end up on my table. Got it?
6192355001225985 The thing we're making will help you a bunch. Come to 诺克金's Castle and see for yourself. But for now, it's a secret. A surprise!
6192355000507347 Yeah? Why are they doing that?
6192355001200389 What is there to celebrate?
6192355000507346 The steppe rabble are dragging a bull through the Hindquarters. Celebrating their cruelty, the beasts…
6192355001200388 Huh. Now <i>that</i> is a sight to behold.
6192355001200391 Yeah, I remember hearing about the bull. So it's in the Hindquarters?
6192355001200387 Now that's a good question! Everyone else mourns while they celebrate. I think you know why. The beasts overflow with joy… Made a half-naked girl ride the thing… Shameless!
6192355000697552 为什么？
6192355000697553 It's not that simple to arrest her. The government gives her free rein.
6192355000697551 They say the 审判官 got arrested, or they'll catch her soon enough.\nIt's for the best. The army will protect us. I imagine the soldiers will be happy to get her. They've always hated these commissars.
6192355000697555 They're hard to miss.
6192355000697556 I haven't. I should take a look.
6192355000697554 Who cares about them here? Authority comes from armed soldiers and a train with cannons. Have you <i>seen</i> those cannons?
6192355000697558 Small wonder…
6192355001524020 But that's no reason to arrest her! She's here on official business.
6192355000697557 They have bad blood from back in the days. Cats and dogs. The inquisition does everything its own way, interfering with the army's plans. They even countermand orders. The generals hate it.
6192355000731152 布拉克. He sure has memory issues, doesn't he?
6192355000731153 Oh, this place is infected? I'll be on my way, then.
6192355000731151 The infected districts are off limits to anyone but medical personnel. Doctor 丹考夫斯基's orders… Are you that Vorakh guy?
6192355000731155 Pills… Well, I guess it's better than nothing.
6192355000731156 Clothes? Does that fop think fleas transmit the disease? It's not a plague! I suppose, though, you can't be too careful…
6192355000731154 Immune boosters, two pills. Protective clothes, one unit. Here you go. And God save you.
6192355001005452 In return, I give you some of my 格里夫.
6192355001038801 Just have some of my warmth. Warmth is life.
6192355001038802 I give you only this item. Perhaps you'll find it useful.
6192355001005451 I've carried this thing for several days. It wasn't easy, of course. With this, I share with you my fear, my sorrow, and my anger. It was tough, but now it's become a little easier. Just a little.\nThank you for easing my burden.
6192355001005454 With this item, I give you… uh, I don't know. Whatever you want.
6192355001038803 I haven't carried this item for long. There's little of me in it. Still, have some of my warmth.
6192355001038804 I share with you some of my 格里夫, because it's all that I have for now. I'm sorry, basaghan.
6192355001005453 With this, I give you some of my hope. We have no doctor now… Who will help us? Who will treat our injuries, or deliver children?\nYou're 一个外科医生。 You can do all that. So have some of our hope. And hope often leads to love.
6192355001005456 Patience.
6192355001038805 Courage.
6192355001038806 Compassion.
6192355001038807 Care.
6192355001038808 Wit. That's what we all need the most now.
6192355001005455 Great. With this item, I give you… some of my luck, I guess? People say I have that in spades. Don't know if I believe it.\nNow, what shall you give me?
6192355001005458 What are <i>you</i> giving <i>me?</i>
6192355001038813 Well… a little joy, I suppose.
6192355001038814 A couple of nice dreams.
6192355001005457 Uh, whatcha giving me with this thing?
6192355001038810 No, that's not how it works. Don't you know the rules?
6192355001038815 Well, neither do I.
6192355001038809 Oh… I don't know.
6192355001038812 Some rest.
6192355001038816 To leave this place.
6192355001038817 To have my 父亲 back, little one. But that's only a dream.
6192355001038811 All right, I'll give you… uh… hmm. What would you like?
6192355001005462 Why there? I don't go there often.
6192355001065699 I know, I grew up here.
6192355001005461 Some of us wait for you at the Square. The Bridge Square, that is. In the Stone Yard. You know how to get there?
6192355001065702 They can wait a bit longer.
6192355001065701 I know the Judge's name, thank you.
6192355001065700 You should. It's pretty. Anyway, they thought you went to see the Judge. 凯恩, I mean. Georgiy.
6192355001065704 I didn't say anything like that.
6192355001065705 I still have business to attend to.
6192355001065703 No, they can't! Go there. They're doing it for you. You shouldn't keep them waiting. We're not your servants.
6192355001022352 I heard nothing.
6192355001065712 Already forgotten.
6192355001022351 Oops! Hush! You shouldn't know about this. Just forget it!
6192355001065707 The Nutshell? Why's it called that?
6192355001065715 You kids really listen to 卡佩拉, don't you?
6192355001065706 卡佩拉 said we can't go to the Nutshell until the evening. So we wait.
6192355001065714 You mean the passenger station?
6192355001065713 Because it's empty! Plus, it's close to the Station.
6192355001065717 Stop wandering, then.
6192355001065718 It's boring everywhere.
6192355001065716 So boring… How much longer do we have to wander the streets…
6192355001065679 Are you out of food?
6192355001065678 I sent my little rats to get groceries this morning, and they still haven't come back! I wonder if they think food will miraculously buy itself.
6192355001065681 Why don't you get groceries yourself? More reliable than children.
6192355001065684 We'll survive on meat. 奥吉姆斯基 isn't entirely heartless. He won't let it come to starvation.
6192355001065680 Have you been living under a rock, darling? Prices are soaring! Salt costs twice as much today as it did yesterday. And where's the grain? I haven't seen wheat in a week. Really, what could happen next?\nThere's <i>still</i> no train. People are worried. What if it never comes? We'll all starve!
6192355001065683 What station?
6192355001065682 How can I be in all places at once? Hmm? I have to send the kids. They're probably at that Station of theirs. Thank the heavens they're not in the Tower, at least… I just don't have the heart to whip them.
6192355001065686 Why don't you go there and fetch them?
6192355001065694 Oh, I know that place. Back in my day, we liked the big Station more.
6192355001065685 It's a place they hang out, waiting on trains. Better than that damned tower.
6192355001065690 Go where?
6192355001065689 Ha, right… If not for the 凯恩s and the 萨普洛夫s, he'd hang himself before he shared anything with the people. You're as naive as a child.\nHmm… I wonder if I should go to the Station and get them…?
6192355001065692 Wonderful. I wonder how you cope with that.
6192355001065693 Hey, thanks for reminding me about the prices!
6192355001065691 I… don't want to meddle. No, it's all right. At least they're in town, staying close. My neighbor hasn't seen her children in… I don't know <i>how</i> long. That damned Tower took them all.
6192355001225990 The turner? What?
6192355001225991 Yes, of course. Let me drop everything and run to fix your "turner."
6192355001225992 Well, since you know the magic word… I suppose it is my duty.
6192355001225989 Hey, uncle! Can you fix the turner for us, please? It's close, over in the Nutshell. Please, please, please! Pretty please!
6192355001225994 …Luck.
6192355001225995 …A windmill.
6192355001225996 …A planet?
6192355001225993 Yeah. A turner. You know… That thing that turns on itself. Like, like…
6192355001225998 Someday, maybe.
6192355001225999 Story of my life in a… uh, in <i>the</i> Nutshell.
6192355001225997 Fix it, will you?
6192355001410652 Well… in a way…
6192355001414351 You all lost it while I was gone.
6192355001410651 The crowd has lost their minds… They believe the plague can be purged with fire, along with anyone infected.
6192355001411360 No. I won't.
6192355001523984 This panic is tearing the Town apart! Can't you see what it brings us to?
6192355001411359 People are frightened for their lives. If a thug attacks you with a knife, will you turn the other cheek? Sand plague is worse than any knife.
6192355001523986 People burning each other!
6192355001523985 What?
6192355001523988 Stop trying to blame everything on the Mistresses. Think for yourself!
6192355001523995 More fantasies. People can't even lose their mind right in this town…
6192355001523987 Mistress 卡特琳娜 taught us the only path to understanding the self is through suffering. We witness the people's interpretation of her words.\nThey're not trying to kill those infected, you know. No… the hope is that pain and fire would cleanse them, somehow. Dark Age hysteria…
6192355001410654 What fight?
6192355001411368 It's not about faith. If you crave violence, you'll find any excuse.
6192355001410653 Have you heard, doctor? People have completely lost faith in you. We've taken up the good fight ourselves—with fire.
6192355001411365 We study microbes to <i>save</i> you assholes.
6192355001523983 You'll sing a different tune if you get infected… God forbid.
6192355001411364 You doctors stand around watching <i>microbes.</i> It's we who suffer. You stash away medicine while we're all on our own…\nPersonally, I'm too scared, but there'll be others. They'll burn the sick. They're beyond salvation, anyway—we remember the First Outbreak. But we'll at least protect ourselves.
6192355001410656 What firestarters?
6192355001411353 Hey, not fair! You've only got red pebbles there!
6192355001411354 You go ahead. I have enough on my plate already.
6192355001410655 Hey, uncle! Let's play firestarters. Take a pebble. If you get a red one, you're sick. Black, and you're a firestarter. We use sticks for bottles.\nGet hit, and you're dead. If you're sick and touch a firestarter, they get infected, too.
6192355001411356 The plague doesn't know kindness.
6192355001411358 You play funny games.
6192355001411355 Everyone wants to play as a firestarter! It's boring to be sick.\nFolks say the firestarters are sick, too. The plague doesn't kill them; it whispers to them, tells them to burn folks so they suffer less. It's kind.
6192355001412355 Cure herself by drowning mice?
6192355001420754 We don't have mice around, though. Only jerboas.
6192355001412354 People say 安娜 went to the river at night to drown mice. Guess she hopes to cure herself.
6192355001420752 Yeah, you clearly don't.
6192355001524019 Throwing sacks into the Gullet? Curious.
6192355001420751 She threw some… sack into the Gullet. I don't know what's inside.\nWe have a custom. To avoid bad fortune, one must drown a mouse. You see, trouble grabs its tail, thinking it has grabbed luck. By the time trouble realizes its mistake, the flow of water drags it away. So she must be drowning mice, even though we don't believe such customs.
6192355001455851 Here, roll it yourself.
6192355001455852 I don't smoke.
6192355001552351 How do you plan to smoke in that thing on your face? Isn't it tight?
6192355001455551 Got a smoke, man?
6192355001552353 A doctor.
6192355001552354 A local butcher.
6192355001552355 Just, you know… an herbalist.
6192355001552352 你是谁, anyway?
6192355001552358 Yes, you're artillery. So you'll likely be ordered to level the Town.
6192355001552359 And what about your legendary general?
6192355001552357 What ugly orders we have… We're artillery, the god of war, commanded by 布洛克将军 himself. The man's a legend. We were headed to the southern front, but they flung us here to fight the plague, somehow.\nHow do they expect us to fight it? We're not medics, we're artillery!
6192355001552361 No. He was sent here to get his hands dirty. You planning to shoot us? Your own people?
6192355001552362 That's possible.
6192355001552360 Here's our theory: our general, he's a thorn in everyone's side up there. I mean, people love him. He's an honest man. Got a personal code. But in that hornet's nest, honest folks are hated.\nSo The Powers That Be sent us here to get sick and die.
6192355001552364 Well, at least that was an honest answer.
6192355001552365 He may not be a butcher, but I am. I'll have to figure out what to do.
6192355001552366 Cares about people, huh? Well, we'll see.
6192355001552363 <i>If</i> there's an order. But the general isn't a butcher. He cares about his people. Still, if he gives an order, we'll follow it, whatever it is.
6192355001455554 No reason at all?
6192355001560325 Yeah, they have guns.
6192355001455553 Be careful around those soldiers. They can kick your ass. Absolutely demolished one of us already, for no good reason.
6192355001457653 Don't take chances with the military.
6192355001458451 Don't pester soldiers. You're asking for trouble.
6192355001560326 Should have looked at the flask and helped himself to the rifle. Would've worked out better.
6192355001457652 Well, he only wanted to have a look at his rifle. And help himself to his flask… Barely got out of there alive.
6192355001457054 They won't fire if we make a cure.
6192355001459558 At least we get to choose now.
6192355001457053 Will there be a barrage? What do we do? The infection may pass, but this… So many cannons… Does this mean they're planning a strike?
6192355001459555 Wait.
6192355001459556 Believe.
6192355001459557 Stay indoors and wash your hands.
6192355001459554 You're taking your sweet time making that cure! But what about us? What do we do?
6192355001459561 Forget it. It was an unfunny joke.
6192355001459560 How to die. We had Plague and Famine before, but now there's War.
6192355001459559 Choose what?
6192355001583878 You can't hide from death under a pile of corpses.
6192355001583879 They burn the sick? Better to avoid them, then.
6192355001583880 The sick are still alive, too.
6192355001583877 Worst thing is, they do have corpsmen. The huge guys with boxes on their backs? They burn the sick. So let them! But why do we, the living, have to suffer? Why do they need to level the Town?
6192355001482352 What's wrong with you all? Now isn't the time for mutinies!
6192355001483685 Don't you see I'm a civilian?
6192355001557153 Everyone's on their own now. Only God is against everyone.
6192355001482351 Are you on our side? Or are you with the mutineers?
6192355001483668 Then fight your deserters. You're burning people alive!
6192355001483669 Makes sense.
6192355001557155 Evil does destroy itself, it seems…
6192355001483667 Deserters.
6192355001483671 There's no miasma!
6192355001483672 Fuck you, too.
6192355001559651 You may face the same fate, one day. You'll sing a different tune then.
6192355001483670 Yes, to stop the spread of miasma… They're already dead, anyway. No one survives this pest of yours. \nSeriously, get lost! Worry about your own skin, not lecturing people.
6192355001482354 No.
6192355001483676 Do I look like a kid flinging dirt around?
6192355001483677 Did they hurt your eye? Let me check…
6192355001482353 You the one who threw a bunch of rocks and dirt at me yesterday? 
6192355001483679 You should have thrown trash back at them.
6192355001483680 All that military discipline broke down, huh? Is it every man for himself?
6192355001483678 We got enough 格里夫 from the locals, but now our own people shoot us in the back! Lost their minds with fear. Idiots…
6192355001483683 You all should leave. You didn't restore order. Just made things worse.
6192355001483684 Some wisdom: Wash your eyes well from the soil, or you'll weep pus.
6192355001483681 You don't see it yourself?
6192355001482356 People have seen him. Here, in the 城镇大厅.
6192355001560327 The front is here now, the most important one.
6192355001482355 This is all a farce. 布洛克将军 never came here. He's at the front, he's always been at the front, I'm telling you.
6192355001483663 Stranger things have happened.
6192355001483665 This isn't a hellhole anymore. It's just hell.
6192355001483662 Those are lies, spread around so that any idiot could give out orders like they'd received them from the great hero 布洛克将军. Why would he ever come to our hellhole? We don't deserve the honor.
6192355001482358 They certainly didn't take them to a playground.
6192355001483655 To a larger town, I suppose. Probably Nizhny or Relsk.
6192355001482357 Where did they take the children? Where, I ask you? They're just going to grind them down to make more soldiers.
6192355001483657 It was his order. He seems like the type to protect people.
6192355001560328 Everyone is scared.
6192355001483656 The General contracted sand pest, I've heard. So there's no command at all—everyone's just shooting one another. Complete anarchy!\nIf it's true, who gave the order about the children? I'm scared…
6192355001499454 Shoot whom?
6192355001499466 Whose order?
6192355001499453 We'll shoot her today! That's the order. She can't run from a bullet.
6192355001499456 What? 为什么？
6192355001559677 I'm going to pretend you didn't tell me that.
6192355001499455 Did you hear? They shot that 审判官 woman down.
6192355001499461 
6192355001499462 
6192355001499460 
6192355001499464 
6192355001499465 
6192355001499463 
6192355001499470 
6192355001499469 
6192355001559671 What? Are you serious?
6192355001559678 Have you lost it? Whose orders were that?
6192355001559670 Why would we want the gaze of The Powers That Be upon us? Nothing for them to see, and the General doesn't need more headaches.\nSuch a death can be chalked up to the plague. We have an order to shoot anyone sick on sight. By nature, the 审判官s are sick people.
6192355001559674 Bullshit. Even you boneheads wouldn't dare attack an 审判官.
6192355001559675 Yes, I need to see her. You have a big mouth.
6192355001559676 Maybe so.
6192355001559672 It's a rumor, but I think it's true. Hard to verify something done so covertly… Hey, why do you care? You need her? You fall in love? Ha.
6192355001559680 Did you see this happen yourself?
6192355001559681 Like hell you'll get a train. No one leaves. You're all staying here.
6192355001559679 No one <i>ordered</i> it. You don't understand what's going on? Anarchy. Just hope to escape with your skin.\nOrders… When there's no order, there's no orders. Just some riflemen barging into that Cathedral of yours. That's how things are done now. All we need is a train back home…
6192355001506960 It's an open question.
6192355001506963 Ever? You think so?
6192355001499754 Our kids are <i>gone.</i> They won't ever return. I can tell.
6192355001506962 They'll be back, as soon as the plague is contained.
6192355001506964 More will be born.
6192355001506965 They'll be safer elsewhere.
6192355001560329 No, it's not. The stork will deliver some more.
6192355001506961 That's it. The Town is officially dead.
6192355001499757 Sure. 你想要什么？
6192355001500078 Not just Cub. When they want me to play a game with them, they call me uncle. Also when they tell me I'm bad at the game.
6192355001499756 You the one the kids call Cub?
6192355001500070 Did it have anything to do with time and fate?
6192355001506951 Let me guess: "I'll only return after they restock the chocolate."
6192355001500069 So it is you, then. My daughter wanted me to relay something to you… before they took her away.
6192355001500076 Oh, this is definitely about fate.
6192355001506956 Come on, stop crying. You'll see her soon, if you manage to survive…
6192355001560331 One more stash…
6192355001500075 She wanted me to give you a note. Said you'd be in "big trouble," otherwise. Now, where I'd put it… in a pocket… a small piece…
6192355001499759 No, it just feels that way to you. Liquid courage.
6192355001500051 Oral disinfectant doesn't work. You're better off washing your hands.
6192355001560332 Twyrine won't purge the disease from the inside—even antibiotics won't.
6192355001499758 Have a drink, pal. Drunks will be safe.
6192355001560334 What did you mean, then?
6192355001560342 That's what <i>I</i> meant, though. Go breathe on someone else.
6192355001560333 That's not what I meant.
6192355001560336 Honest? Like hell. You need to get hammered to find a trunk in a yard?
6192355001560337 Those are kids' caches. They have… well, they <i>had</i> this game.
6192355001560338 "Shmowders." I know. They can kill you.
6192355001560335 Drink twyrine, and your legs will carry you to small stashes. Hidden in old, broken furniture lying around the street, and such…\nSometimes, there's small boxes in those stashes, filled with powder. If you eat it, you'll get well. There's been a few cases already. Honest.
6192355001560340 I think you need some sleep, pal. That's your salvation.
6192355001560341 Oh, it leads you all right, just not in a straight line.
6192355001560343 Sure… Anything could happen.
6192355001560339 No need to get <i>hammered,</i> that's undignified. Only, twyrine… it <i>leads</i> you. To salvation. To those tiny boxes.
6192355001560345 Are you drunk?
6192355001560346 I know.
6192355001560344 The Town can hear you. Walk slowly. Move quietly. You hurt it.
6192355001499771 I don't know. What makes you think so?
6192355001513958 Remind me, the Dogheads are…?
6192355001499770 Hey uncle, are the Dogheads done for? Or is there a mutiny?
6192355001513952 Where did he go?
6192355001513951 I don't know, either! 可汗 left them. But 为什么？ Did they force him out?
6192355001513954 Hm… I <i>am</i> interested.
6192355001513961 You've got enough fun for two, though.
6192355001513953 To the Nutshell, of course!\nOur lot said he's sitting there, all shut in and refusing to come out. Aren't you interested in what happened? You're so boring!
6192355001583872 It's just… 诺克金's lot could also be called that, couldn't they? They have bonds with their animals. Don't they get confused about sides?
6192355001583873 Got it. So is there some trouble?
6192355001583871 The dog-headed ones. 可汗's army. They live in the Tower. Are you all right in the head, uncle?
6192355001583875 Fair enough. So what happened at the Dogheads' place?
6192355001583874 Not at all. The Soul-and-a-Halves get half a soul more, and the Dogheads get half a head. Not even remotely similar.
6192355001510153 You look healthy. That's what matters.
6192355001509352 Well, I wouldn't shake your hand.
6192355001510164 Is there any trust left at all in this town?
6192355001509351 Hey, stranger. Take a good look at me. Do I look <i>that</i> untrustworthy? Is my face really only good for pointing a gun at?
6192355001510157 Was one of yours there?
6192355001510165 What kids?
6192355001510154 You'll meet them again.
6192355001510151 To hell with those squaddies. They didn't let me near the Station, so I couldn't even say goodbye! I just wanted one last look at the kids. Just for that, they damn near shot me!
6192355001510159 I'm sorry.
6192355001510162 Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
6192355001560330 They'll be back. You'll see. And more will come.
6192355001510158 Not my children—I'm a teacher. Organized classes… You know we lack a proper school, but they did show up. They worked hard, even…
6192355001510167 Fair enough.
6192355001510166 Haven't you heard? They've been evacuated. At least they're safe…\nIt's how it should be. When a ship sinks, the lifeboats go to the women and children first. You just have to hope there's enough space for them.
6192355001523997 In the "marble nest"?
6192355001523998 "Sister Steppe"? I thought it was perceived as a mother.
6192355001523996 Sister Steppe holds some herbs in her bosom. Others, she grants to us. Then there are special herbs, the ones in the marble nest itself.
6192355001524000 So where does your sister keep the special herbs?
6192355001523999 Mother to you. Sister to me.
6192355001524002 Huh. Why is that?
6192355001524003 That's useful information. Thank you.
6192355001524001 In the Town.\nWhite whip is a bitter herb. It splits open the ground in infected districts.\nAshen swish grows wherever swishing is heard, like the singing of sharpened knives. It can be found in districts where blood is shed.
6192355001524005 They do taste different.
6192355001524006 Thank you for the advice, friend.
6192355001524004 Herbs are people, too. Each has a different taste.
6192355001524008 Who?
6192355001524007 She's dancing by the cemetery today.
6192355001524010 I don't have a bride.
6192355001524011 My bride… You mean the strange girl that follows me around?
6192355001524009 Your bride.
6192355001524013 …Can you at least tell me who she is?
6192355001524014 What does this mean for me?
6192355001524012 She's dancing by the cemetery today.
6192355001524016 No! I don't…
6192355001524017 I'm not a butcher. I'm 一个外科医生。
6192355001524015 She's an 草药新娘. You're a butcher. You know the rest.
6192355001524023 What trial?
6192355001524024 Silence? How will your silence be of help to me?
6192355001524022 A bow to you, emshen. A bow, yargachin. You see the Lines far ahead; we only see them close. Earth tells us that 布拉克's Line will lead him to great wrath soon. You will face a trial.\nTo help, we offer you a gift: our silence.
6192355001524026 Oh, come on. It's the opposite. I need your advice…
6192355001524025 Are you testing me? You already know: the Lines are the art of hearing. Hearing the cavities within solid bodies; hearing the points where flesh longs to give in; hearing where <i>the world</i> longs to give in.\nYou're a hearer. Murmurs and commotion distract you. So we fall silent.
6192355001524028 I know nothing.
6192355001524029 But how will your silence help?
6192355001524027 You know that better than me, yargachin. Isn't there enough pain in your life?
6192355001524032 I hope you reconsider.
6192355001583876 Other people are reluctant to talk now, too. No one want to touch others anymore, not even with words.
6192355001524030 You need no advice from the crowd, or the murmuring of passers.\nListen to your heart, emshen. Listen to whoever is important. The Kin will no longer speak to you in the streets.
6192355001524034 Exhaustion makes everything a blur.
6192355001524035 Yeah! It's like it moves faster now. You've noticed it, too?
6192355001524033 Time has become denser, somehow. Can you feel it?
6192355001524037 Not "something," but someone. Half the people around… The bitch.
6192355001524038 If she's broken something, it would have been on purpose, believe me.
6192355001524036 You can tell. Where does time come from? The Cathedral makes it. That's why it's always been empty. No need to crowd the place; time can only move on freely when it's empty.\nAnd she's sitting there like a spider. Must have broken something.
6192355001560323 为什么？
6192355001560324 Right, all trouble comes from emissaries. Anything's wrong, blame 'em.
6192355001560322 It's that 审判官 woman. She made herself a nest in the Cathedral, and here's the result! That's why time runs faster now. And it's denser…
6192355001524040 Yes, Khatangher. Do it.
6192355001524041 No, it's a bad idea.
6192355001524039 ............
6192355001524043 Sure. I understand.
6192355001524046 .......
6192355001524042 .........?
6192355001524045 Bayarlaa, Khatangher.
6192355001524047 ........
6192355001524044 ............
6192355001078452 
6192355001078453 
6192355001078451 
6192355001078455 What will she teach you?
6192355001078456 What if she interprets it wrong? You know how it can be.
6192355001078457 She won't. 萨巴 is dead. And I'm to blame… I think that means I should answer your questions myself.
6192355001078454 萨巴 will teach us. She knows the way. She speaks to Earth. Mother Boddho talks to us through her.
6192355001078459 Well. Good luck remembering.
6192355001078460 What advising do you need?
6192355001078461 She won't advise you anymore.
6192355001078458 She knows our traditions. We have long been oppressed. Now we face extinction. We forget our language, our crafts and arts. The art of talking to Earth, the language of herbs, the craft of Lines. She advises well.
6192355001078463 Oh… So she does make mistakes, after all.
6192355001078464 So she's a teacher to you?
6192355001078462 Impossible. It's not religious. Just wisdom. Mundane advice. Heart will tell if she's wrong, certainly, but 萨巴 rarely is.
6192355001078466 I'm sure it's simpler than you think.
6192355001078467 That wasn't an offer, by the way. I'm a bad advisor.
6192355001078465 Not a simple one.
6192355001078469 When what happens?
6192355001078470 Yes.
6192355001078468 I have a question for our mother. \nThere is little time left before it all ends. When it happens, would I be allowed to spare the lives of those who trusted me and called themselves friends? Would I be allowed to not kill them?
6192355001078472 Are you all nuts? Just leave people alone.
6192355001078473 Kill everyone. God will tell the good from the bad.
6192355001078474 Dream on…
6192355001078471 When the Kin flood the town. When the steppe consumes the streets and houses. What shall I do to people, then?
6192355001078476 Bad idea. Such marriages lead to degradation.
6192355001078478 Marry the townsfolk. That's the only way to survive.
6192355001078477 Yeah… You should ask her.
6192355001078475 I want to ask 萨巴.\nWill our brothers and sisters be allowed to marry? The Kin are… well, kin. We're all children of Boddho. And there's so few of us left…
6192355001078480 No, you're not.
6192355001078481 That's the idea.
6192355001078479 We're too different.
6192355001078483 …And you'll become the Kin's last generation.
6192355001078484 Dream on.
6192355001078482 But that doesn't matter. When the Kin swallow the Town, there'll be neither wives nor children.
6192355001078486 …What for?
6192355001078487 Wisdom springs from hindsight…
6192355001078485 I would ask Mother about self-sacrifice. \nShe said we must sacrifice everything for our fellow Kin, as we prepare to flood the Town… I gave everything I had, even my own entrails. Now I'm dying. Did I make the correct decision?
6192355001078489 If you're asking me, it was a stupid thing to do.
6192355001078490 You did good.
6192355001583883 You won't tell her anything.
6192355001078488 I will tell it to 萨巴. It's a long story. I should save my strength.
6192355001078492 How will you refer to each other, then?
6192355001078493 I agree. All names do is hinder communication.
6192355001078491 I want to abandon my name. So does my family: the etseg eyh, the abgay, the basaghan, the akshan.\nWhy would we need names? We're no one.
6192355001078495 You want to abandon your name, but you still refer to yourself with "I." Shouldn't you start with that?
6192355001078496 No. A name is just a shell. Peel it off.
6192355001078497 Your name <i>is</i> you. He who has it, has power over you.
6192355001078494 We do not need names to call on each other. We do not need words.\nI want to ask our mother if we'd lose anything vital by shedding names.
6192355001078499 You can try to deny yourself if you want. But why stop loving yourself?
6192355001078500 Then shed your body.
6192355001078498 We want to ask our mother: How can we deny ourselves?\nMy body won't let me forget it. I can't stop loving myself while I still have a body.
6192355001078502 A curious question indeed.
6192355001078503 Go home. No one can teach you this.
6192355001078504 You don't truly love yourself, I can tell. Learn that first. Love is harder than denial.
6192355001078501 I don't know. But I can tell that it's a hindrance.\nI want to ask 萨巴 of this. Let her teach me.
6192355001078506 Speak the steppe tongue. Teleghyy yaakhav, naayze.
6192355001078507 Give a vow of silence and be quiet.
6192355001078505 I want to ask our mother about our speech. This foreign tongue impedes us. It slows our minds. How can we refuse it?
6192355001078509 Why don't you think in the language of your ancestors?
6192355001078510 In that case, how about you lend your brain to someone who'd use it?
6192355001078508 You hear me not, bagshaah. I'm <i>thinking</i> with these words.\nI told you, it's my mind they cripple, not my mouth.
6192355001078512 So there's your answer, then.
6192355001078513 Invent new words. This is how you can serve our people.
6192355001078511 Tegdegh, bagshaa, but it's too bare. Too many new things in life, that have no names in the steppe tongue.
6192355001207652 The Town is calling to me...
6192355001239564 Yes.
6192355001239565 You two again?
6192355001239566 What list?
6192355001239563 Are you certain everyone on your list still lives?
6192355001239568 Go home, brats.
6192355001239569 I keep track of everything.
6192355001239567 Are you <i>very sure indeed</i> they live? Have you seen each one of them lately? Paid them a visit? You better watch out…
6192355001239571 Oh… you mean the one from my 父亲's legacy. Yeah, I think so.
6192355001239572 I remember now. One list is enough.
6192355001239570 Do you keep many lists?
6192355001254694 Now is not the time for love.
6192355001254695 There is no "us." There's me, and there's you. Deal with your life yourself.
6192355001254693 What do you plan to do about us, kheerkhen?
6192355001254697 Then why are you following me?
6192355001254698 Well…
6192355001254696 …What makes you think I love you?
6192355001254700 You are an 草药新娘. Betrothed to the Earth, not to men. You're not a creature of love…
6192355001254701 Ugh. Spare me.
6192355001254699 Baygalday, you're breaking my heart… if only that were true! You don't even know how cruel your words are.
6192355001254704 So what's your actual name?
6192355001254703 Live, then. No one's stopping you.
6192355001254702 You know full well we're not the kind who love. It's not about love at all, khөөrkhen. I'd rather live than love.
6192355001254706 Fair enough.
6192355001254707 You're a good dancer, Bride. Bayarlaa to you for the good harvest.
6192355001254705 Why do you ask? You'll remember it yourself, when the time comes.
6192355001254709 Thank heavens…
6192355001254710 Can you <i>please</i> tell me your name now?
6192355001254711 Where's the bull?
6192355001254708 I've decided that I won't bother you anymore.
6192355001254713 When what time comes?
6192355001254714 I'm tired of your riddles. 你想要什么？
6192355001254715 Scared of what? I'm not afraid of you, and I doubt I ever will be.
6192355001254712 What matters is, you got used to me. Now, you won't be so scared when the time comes. It will be easier for you. So have no regrets.
6192355001254717 "He said…" Wait, today?
6192355001254718 Yamar berkhe!
6192355001254716 Be khara, he went into the steppe. He said he'll be back.
6192355001254720 Listen… whatsyername…
6192355001254721 Good.
6192355001254719 Don't worry, khөөrkhen. Your booha will return. Unlike me.
6192355001254723 Nara… Nara… No. I don't.
6192355001254724 You're an 草药新娘. Earth's flesh. I never had much contact with your kind.
6192355001254722 Nara. <i>Narana.</i> So you don't remember me at all?
6192355001254726 What?!
6192355001254727 You know what? If I ever see you again, I sure will. Now oshysh daa, be on your way, basaghan!
6192355001254725 You will have to kill me at some point. I told you—I'm yours, yargachin.
6192355001254729 Yeah, yeah. Tell me already.
6192355001254730 Honestly? Not really.
6192355001254728 Are you sure you want to know?
6192355001254732 I think I understand now.
6192355001254733 So that's what our connection is…
6192355001254734 Let someone else kill you. Ask the Worms, maybe. Murder comes naturally to them.
6192355001254731 Don't be sad, and don't be frightened when it happens. We do not fear death. Tiimel daa, we're indifferent to it. But it will help you understand.
6192355001254736 I'm cutting you right. Bear with me and be quiet.
6192355001254737 [cut down and to the right]
6192355001254735 You cut me wrong. You're opening the spleen. But it's too early.
6192355001254739 I know the future already. I'm looking for different answers now.
6192355001254740 [cut up]
6192355001254738 You won't see the future this way.
6192355001254742 [cut down]
6192355001254743 [cut left]
6192355001254741 There is no pain,  khөөrkhen. You are yargachin. What your blade cuts is not a body. You're tracing emptiness. A predestined Line.
6192355001254745 Almost. I can almost see why you people, who devour meat raw, are unaffected by this disease.
6192355001254746 [cut right]
6192355001254744 Did you find it?
6192355001254748 Who were you in life? Did you dance with Earth?
6192355001254749 [cut up]
6192355001254747 We love you, yargachin. You're doing everything right.\nYou're getting closer now… Soon we become whole with you. A Kharanghe…
6192355001255551 [cut up]
6192355001255552 [keep cutting left]
6192355001254750 Can't you see? I'm dancing with Earth now.\nYou're cutting me open so that Earth may live. This is how it's been since ancient times. \nYou're doing everything right. I'm so thankful…
6192355001255554 [keep cutting]
6192355001255555 [change direction, cut up]
6192355001255553 It hurts! Zobo, zobo, unente, aaaah! It hurts!!
6192355001255557 I'm not killing you. You're still alive.
6192355001255558 [cut down]
6192355001255556 Why do they do it? Why do they build such unbearable towns?\nThe Earth doesn't want this town. It's killing her like you're killing me now.
6192355001255560 Earth. It's… she's breathing.
6192355001255561 [cut up]
6192355001255559 What do you see?
6192355001255563 No. You're made of flesh, like a normal person.
6192355001255564 [cut down]
6192355001255562 I'm made of Earth.
6192355001255566 [cut straight]
6192355001255567 [cut down]
6192355001255565 I'll be alive afterwards, too. My blood will trickle down into the Earth, and I will become an herb. I hope it's swevery…
6192355001255569 Yes.
6192355001255570 [cut up]
6192355001255568 This <i>is</i> earth. Earth is flesh. Hot blood flows through it. It gives birth, gets sick, endures, and suffers.\nWe are flesh of the Earth's flesh, yargachin. And so is the disease killing you. But it's of no danger to us while we're connected to the Earth.\nNow you've seen it.
6192355001255572 It… it does look like Earth. What is it?
6192355001255573 It's beautiful.
6192355001255571 Do you see it? What do you see?
6192355001508852 It's you…
6192355001508853 Nara. Your name is Nara.
6192355001508857 I recognize you.
6192355001508851 We finally meet, khөөrkhen. Do what you must.
6192355001508855 I… I can't…
6192355001508856 You knew all, this time…
6192355001508854 It's me.
6192355001255752 Ah. It's you, basaghan.
6192355001255753 Your dress is even more torn than before. You danced with all your energy, huh?
6192355001255751 I'm sorry about your loss. Still, think bright thoughts. Earth takes her due, but gives in kind.\nHave you now remembered me? Do you remember our connection?
6192355001255755 I see…
6192355001255756 Bayarlaa. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355001255754 I needed to make Earth split open. To lay your 父亲 to rest.
6192355001255758 What is your name?
6192355001255759 I've no need for such gifts.
6192355001255757 I'm all yours, kheerkhen.
6192355001255761 No. I honestly don't.
6192355001255762 You know? I don't believe you. I feel like this is all some sort of a prank. Or game, maybe.
6192355001255760 So you don't remember at all?
6192355001255764 Wait… It can't be!
6192355001255765 I never told anyone about it. Even my friends. Even 劳拉 doesn't know.
6192355001255763 This is what you told me once: "I often dream of salt. Either its taste, or color, or whole salt pits, or holding some in my pinched fingers." Do you believe me now?
6192355001255767 Why then?
6192355001255766 Baar可汗e, baar可汗e… Forget 劳拉… That's not why I'm following you.
6192355001255769 I'm not the type to hold grudges.
6192355001255770 I can't promise anything.
6192355001255768 Ene shee yuun khun gheeshebshe… But you're not heartless, however cruel. I won't leave you. I hold no grudge against you.\nJust mind this: When you finally remember; when you realize why you need me, do not hold a grudge, either. Promise?
6192355001255772 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai! I couldn't forget even if I tried...
6192355001255773 Don't try to bind me. I told you already, I don't need you.
6192355001255774 All right. I'll remember.
6192355001255771 Don't send me away. We are bound, you and I. I am yours. Remember that, at least.
6192355001255794 你是谁？
6192355001255795 You mistook me for someone else, basaghan.
6192355001255796 Wait… I seem to recognize your face.
6192355001255793 Finally, we're back together. I've been waiting for you, 布拉克. Will you have me now?
6192355001255798 You are an 草药新娘. We can't have a relationship.
6192355001255799 You have a very clear speech for a Bride. Do you live in the Town?
6192355001255797 Don't you remember me, kholboön? Well, I remember you. And I remember your words. So, will you have me now?
6192355001255801 I'm not touching you.
6192355001255802 Relax, I'll be careful. I'm just checking if you're real.
6192355001255800 Your hands are so heavy. Shh, don't touch me yet. Or else the dress will tear, and it's no good.\nThe tears in the dress must appear on their own, during the dance. Just like the Earth is torn apart when it releases herbs.
6192355001255804 But… 你是谁？
6192355001255805 No, basaghan. Something is off about you. What do you really want?
6192355001255806 Were we… lovers?
6192355001255803 So, will you have me now? Will we be joined forever?
6192355001255808 Don't worry.
6192355001255809 I will wait for you, basaghan.
6192355001255810 You are beautiful.
6192355001255807 Fine. I'll wait for you to remember me. We'll meet again soon. I'll find you.\nFor now, try to remember who I am, kholboön. Segne dehe, or there'll be trouble.
6192355001255574 Nara
6192355001315852 What…?
6192355001315851 It was a pathologic change in many lives, mine included. It filled me to the brim.
6192355001315854 Makes sense.
6192355001315853 According to a certain treatise on war, each type of terrain requires a particular approach. If there's a mountain ahead, a river to the right, starvation to the left, and the foe ahead, the terrain is called "desperate."\nThe treatise gives only one piece of advice on overcoming it: Fight.
6192355001315856 That's a shame.
6192355001315855 We're wasting years copying what already existed, and have no time to add anything original on top.
6192355001315858 No pressure.
6192355001315857 It feels wrong for me to make confessions.
6192355001315860 What do you mean?
6192355001315859 I'll have you know we used to want to change the world. And perhaps we did, a bit… But lately, it seems to me that all we're doing is trying to translate someone's childhood traumas and dreams.\nWake that child up, and it all evaporates.
6192355001315862 Cheers…?
6192355001315861 It's a capricious child. Every day, it demands more strength and attention than I could possibly have. Yet every minute spent on it is repaid in spades! I feel like I'm about to burst.\nIt stole my time, but gave me a family.
6192355001315864 …
6192355001315863 i constantly feel like a 信使 who is to be shot for bringing bad news
6192355001315866 …
6192355001315865 head deep in the second outbreak\ni feel like i've grasped the idea of death\nextracted its essence, that is present in the living too\nnow i need to write my observations down\nwhile i am yet unliving
6192355001315868 In the right direction.
6192355001734151 Dunno, it just trudges on...
6192355001734152 Nowhere, that's where.
6192355001315867 Would it have seen the light of day without me? Most certainly. But I hope my participation made it better! I dissolved in it, and breathed it...\n...Where is reality going now?
6192355001315870 Are you asking me?
6192355001315869 I still struggle to evaluate my degree of responsibility for all this. I offered so many ideas, yet made so few decisions. So how much of the result is on me?
6192355001315872 …
6192355001315871 I accidentally shifted the trajectory of my life. This world wields uncanny power that changes anyone who touches it. Playing it is a challenge, making it—even more so.\nI'm not sure if I made a terrible mistake when I rushed into it.
6192355001315874 …
6192355001315873 I failed to hold all that was dear to me. Put it all on this altar. The 史迪奇 terror makes me lose control of my thoughts. But it's too late to give up. I go all in.
6192355001315876 Are you two twins…?
6192355001315875 My main fear is missing the opportunity to do something that matters. This is my door to leaving <i>something</i> after I go. I gave up everything to go through this door.\nBut I don't really know what's on the other side.
6192355001315878 …
6192355001315877 im here because theyre dead\nwho is to die so we\nstop failing\nis it all right that\n               im happy
6192355001315880 Good for you.
6192355001315879 I like it. It's the story of strong people in a tough situation. A story of responsibility, the will to cleanse your doubts, the power to go on despite the exhaustion and mistakes, the wrongness and incomprehensibility. It's hard, but meaningful.\nAnd I am happy to be here.
6192355001315882 …What about me?
6192355001315881 Each new person was a hope of miraculous salvation. But a year ago we finally faced it: no one had any obligations to become our savior.
6192355001315884 …
6192355001315883 Five years of my life. Several hours of your leisure.
6192355001315886 Oh come on.
6192355001315885 Embarking on a journey, we often think that the goal is to get somewhere. And it may take years of wandering to see that it was never about the destination at all.
6192355001315888 Are you being serious?
6192355001315887 I think tackling the fourth wall so directly is kind of tasteless in the modern world.
6192355001315890 But that's not how it turned out.
6192355001315889 My true desire was for this town to never have a direction or goal marker, not even once. It's intellectually offensive.\nWho do you have to be to thrust a map marker under a free person's nose, saying, <i>"Here is your goal. You're too lazy and stupid to figure it out on your own, and I am not without mercy towards lesser minds, so I'll do the work for you. Go there. Go and don't forget to thank me for choosing your goal for you. Love, The Powers That Be."</i>—?
6192355001315892 …
6192355001315891 I love you all…
6192355001423594 I see.
6192355001423593 This is a bizarre time that started with the courageous "do as you please" and delved into "this is the only way to go." I'm not sure anything <i>I</i> wanted to say found its way here.
6192355001535865 No, I'm fi—
6192355001535866 —no. I can't…
6192355001535867 … say all that I…
6192355001535868 want.
6192355001535864 He's… war… a magic pie… a letter… silken… at gunpoint… BLAM—e… and asph—alt drawings.\nI c-c-can't say—it. Are your wo—rds falling apart… too? Oh. Can it be c-c-contagiou—s?
6192355001535870 Relatable.
6192355001535869 I like new beginnings. Anticipation is the most invigorating part! That's why I was introduced to it so late. Oh well…
6192355001386038 Do you remember me?
6192355001388984 I don't know. I only know I did this. It's all my fault.
6192355001386037 What does it all mean… for us all?
6192355001386040 I'm a doctor. 阿泰米·布拉克.
6192355001388981 Where are you going? There's nothing there.
6192355001386039 I think I do… You belonged to our house, didn't you? Oh, no, pardon me… You were a courier. Right? You brought in deliveries? …Maybe not. I'm sorry. \nBut your face does seem familiar…
6192355001386042 No. I… have a different path.
6192355001386043 I'll catch up with you… later.
6192355001388988 I'm going back.
6192355001386041 No.\nWill you come with us? The path ahead is long and hard. The more go, the better our chances.
6192355001386050 You will.
6192355001388989 How did this happen? What's wrong with you all? Have you gone insane?
6192355001386049 阿泰米·布拉克? No, sorry. I don't remember the name.
6192355001388983 Just ahead?
6192355001388982 Ahead.
6192355001388986 Yes. What's wrong with childhood?
6192355001388987 It's not the river of life. It's the steppe. Earth. You can walk it in any direction.
6192355001388985 As if there was any other direction to go. Are you suggesting I return to my childhood?
6192355001388566 Do you recognize me?
6192355001388995 …But I don't. Perhaps <i>you</i> can tell <i>me</i> what it all means?
6192355001388565 Hey… What does it all mean? For me, personally? You have to know.
6192355001388569 I knew it! I knew you wouldn't forget me—not you!
6192355001388990 Where are you all going?
6192355001388568 Of course I recognize you.
6192355001388571 No… Please, not a word more.
6192355001388999 Yes. Things have changed.
6192355001389000 …Farewell.
6192355001388570 You're Matvei Shiroky. Huh… We haven't seen each other for what, four years now? You've changed a lot… Barely recognizable.
6192355001388578 Whew… For a moment there, I thought… You had a bizarre look. Sorry for doubting you.
6192355001388996 Yes. Of course we're friends.
6192355001388577 You're my friend.
6192355001388992 There are no lights! Only darkness.
6192355001388993 Towards death. Towards the steppe. It takes a <i>train</i> three days to cross it!
6192355001388994 Hey… do you remember who I am?
6192355001388991 Over there. Towards the lights.
6192355001388998 Yes. I'll always be with you.
6192355001389001 No. I'm going home.
6192355001389002 I'm with you. Yes. Let's go.
6192355001388997 Are you with us?
6192355001389004 As if you didn't know.
6192355001389005 You tell me. I mean it, tell me! Who am I to you?
6192355001389003 Depends on who you are.
6192355001388608 Your eyes are so… hollow. Do you recognize me?
6192355001388609 Where are you all going?
6192355001388607 What it all entails…
6192355001388611 阿泰米·布拉克. I… used to be a doctor here. For a bit.
6192355001388975 It doesn't matter… I'm no one now.
6192355001388610 No, I don't. 你是谁？
6192355001388613 No.
6192355001388614 Yes, I am. You go ahead… I'll catch up later.
6192355001388612 Are you coming with us?
6192355001388616 为什么？
6192355001388980 Do you remember me?
6192355001388976 That's not where east is. Then again… no matter.
6192355001388615 East.
6192355001388618 Don't go…
6192355001388977 It's not.
6192355001388978 True. Any place is better for humans now… than this.
6192355001388617 It's better there.
6192355001388620 Please try to remember.
6192355001388979 I see.
6192355001388619 Doesn't ring a bell.
6192355001388352 It's a marsh. Just walk around me.
6192355001388353 Don't go.
6192355001388354 You're welcome. No one will stop you.
6192355001388351 Don't stand in my way. Let me through.
6192355001388359 Did you not build enough?
6192355001388363 It's not mud. It's earth.
6192355001388355 Perhaps there I can build whatever I failed to build here. At least I won't have to stand knee-deep in the mud.
6192355001388365 Stay with me.
6192355001388366 If only the personality matched...
6192355001388364 You have such a good, honest face.
6192355001388369 In the Town.
6192355001388370 Here. Things will be different now.
6192355001388371 In the past.
6192355001388368 Where?
6192355001388373 I know.
6192355001388374 I'm so sorry.
6192355001388372 …You have such a good, honest face.
6192355001388376 Yes… It's beautiful.
6192355001388377 Yes… It's beautiful. Please don't leave?
6192355001388375 So beautiful… Look at the moon.
6192355001388381 No, it won't.
6192355001388382 Fine. Go if you want to.
6192355001388380 It'll be better there.
6192355001388387 What?
6192355001388388 Well… it doesn't sound so bad.
6192355001388386 Some say it'll be very hot. Others, freezing cold. But I don't think it has a temperature at all.
6192355001388390 You can still stop all this, you know. If you only tried…
6192355001388391 Fine.
6192355001388389 The ahead.
6192355001397152 为什么？
6192355001397153 What, across the steppe? On foot?
6192355001397151 We're leaving.
6192355001397155 But 为什么？
6192355001397156 It's not true!
6192355001397154 I have no place here anymore.
6192355001397158 Anything… Why leave?
6192355001397159 Just… live. We'll find a way. It won't be so hard.
6192355001397157 What else could I do?
6192355001397161 But why leave? Why leave <i>like this?</i>
6192355001397162 But it does! It accepts all kinds of people…
6192355001397160 This town is no longer mine. No longer human. No longer rational. It doesn't… accept the likes of me anymore.
6192355001397164 I don't understand…
6192355001397165 为什么？
6192355001397163 Yes.
6192355001397167 Would living in this new world strain your common sense and judgment? Is that it?
6192355001397168 Are you scared the sand pest will come back? It will! But it's no longer a threat to us!
6192355001397169 The bulls… Is that it? They scare me too. They came back… but will go, eventually. And, well, aren't they beautiful? The past resurrected! Who could imagine…
6192355001397166 I didn't really have a choice.
6192355001397171 Then what is it all about? Yes, the weird, magic, inexplicable beings have returned to life… but wouldn't it be a shame to lose them? Have you no pity?
6192355001397172 You know, humans… are all about <i>warmth.</i> All that happened is just a consequence of that. Warmth and love… Although, I'm not a fan of the word. But… do I make any sense?
6192355001397170 No. You don't understand.
6192355001397174 So this is it? There, ahead of you… lies death.
6192355001397175 I'm just bad at putting it all into words. I understand, but… Look, what happened here is the greatest victory of Life in history!
6192355001397173 No.
6192355001397177 But why do you have to go then?
6192355001397176 Yes.
6192355001397179 Well… I can't stop you.
6192355001397180 I… I had to do it. I'm sorry.
6192355001397181 I've nothing to blame myself for.
6192355001397178 Because I must. Simple as that.
6192355001499070 You're all too independent! Scattered around like a bunch of cubs... Do you know where 格蕾丝 is now?
6192355001523967 Where do I find 可汗?
6192355001523970 ...
6192355001499069 .....
6192355001523972 What about 可汗?
6192355001523975 I see... thanks.
6192355001523971 She lives at 彼得 斯塔马丁's place.
6192355001523974 What about 格蕾丝?
6192355001523976 Thank you.
6192355001523973 He's in the Nutshell.
6192355001566766 Your "Master"?
6192355001566767 Since when do people have masters in this town, boy?
6192355001566768 What for?
6192355001566765 Master says you're doing well. He said, "With each hour, fewer and fewer people think he's the murderer." He said, "Tell him that I want to talk; let him come to the Lump." Right away.
6192355001566770 Ah, 奥吉姆斯基. What does he want with me?
6192355001566769 大 维拉德.
6192355001566772 True. If 大 维拉德 calls, you come.
6192355001566773 I'll come by when I can. You tell him that.
6192355001566774 If he needs me so much, let him come to me.
6192355001566771 If he's summoning you, you must go. "No dawdling," he said.
6192355001566776 Perhaps 奥吉姆斯基 wants me in his service as well?
6192355001566777 We'll see about that.
6192355001566775 Don't you know? We all have but one true master since the Factory was built.
6192355001566779 Won't be easy for him.
6192355001566780 What does he want?
6192355001566778 Perhaps he does.
6192355001566782 Who's your master?
6192355001566783 Right away, huh? Well who am I to refuse such a thoughtful and polite invitation?
6192355001566784 Since when do people have masters in this town, boy?
6192355001566781 Master says you need protection. He said, "I don't think he's the killer." He said, "Tell him that I want to talk; let him come to the Lump." Right away.
