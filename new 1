6192355000959488 What inspection?
6192355000959489 So barrels have guards standing over them now?
6192355000959487 An inspection, eh? 'Tis all silliness, if you ask me. The water is all right. People drank it, and no one died.
6192355001257868 You've lived long enough to have wrinkles, yet you still believe someone would infect people on purpose?
6192355001257869 So the Kin is to blame for everything? Great. Go on, tell me more. I'm all ears.
6192355001257870 What a lady… Always up to all sorts of mischief, despite the bone legs!
6192355001257867 Rumor is, steppe people infected the barrels last night. Don't take offense, sir! Might also have been the plague-bearer, the bone-legged wench. \nRemember the hunt for her? Well, where there's smoke, there's fire. Guess there was a good reason behind the hunt, after all.
6192355001257874 So what does that professor of yours say?
6192355001257875 If you don't believe it, 你是谁 protecting the barrel from?
6192355001257873 Don't make fun of me, doctor. You live to my age, you'll sing a different tune.\nEven the professor from the Capital, a book smart man, isn't laughing anymore. He realizes now our traditions should be respected. Yeah… You don't have to believe them deep down, but show some respect.
6192355001257877 What would be the point, if it's already infected?
6192355001257876 Oh, I don't! But an order came through this morning, barrels must be guarded—as many as we have manpower to guard. Tough that the Master is the only one with enough free men…\nMaybe it's to protect the water from someone infecting it, too. Can't be too sure.
6192355001257879 The 高洪河 flows in the opposite direction!
6192355001257883 Sounds bad… So now what?
6192355001257878 I've been told to stand guard here, 'cause those are our last sips of clear water. The water pipes were destroyed last night. The fools decided the infection's waterborne, from the 高洪河.\nIt's polluted, true, with blood and innards from the屠宰场.
6192355001257881 Doing your best to drive everyone nuts, aren't you?
6192355001257882 Sounds right. Dying of thirst is better than dying of sand pest. Less tortuous.
6192355001257880 Master's orders. Very thoughtful of him. And 萨普洛夫 issued an order, too. One bottle per person, and not a drop more.
6192355001638960 Let's assume he did. How do I examine one?
6192355001257884 An order's been issued: all barrels are to be examined. If anything suspicious is found, all barrels from that part of town are to be seized. Can't be too sure.\n学者 丹考夫斯基 is in charge of the process. It's all up to him. Hence my question: Did he send you to inspect the barrels?
6192355001638962 Could you drag a barrel to a different location for me? It'd be easier to check there. And I don't think I can move a barrel on my own...
6192355001638963 Already running. At breakneck speed.
6192355001638961 Are <i>you</i> asking <i>me,</i> doctor?\nI guess you take a sample. Then... hold it to the light? Taste it? And run to professor 丹考夫斯基 to report if anything is off.
6192355001638965 So you would relocate a suspicious one? Got it.
6192355001638966 I'll inspect barrels first. decide later.
6192355001638967 I have a bad feeling about this...
6192355001638964 为什么？ Examine it here. Unless you find a suspicious barrel... then experiments are mandatory, I guess?
6192355000959491 This barrel is clear. Stand your guard. Water is more precious than gold now.
6192355001248951 You know what, pal? Take this barrel to the cape, to 拉薇尔's house.
6192355000959490 Your decision, doctor?
6192355001248953 For the good of the people.
6192355001257862 Orders.
6192355001257863 Because I told you to.
6192355001248952 Huh? What for?
6192355001257865 All right, all right… Whatever you say.
6192355001257866 It was a test. Well done.
6192355001257864 Eh? And who deserves this treasure, I wonder? For what service?\nNo way in hell! My orders are clear. If the water is clear, it's precious. A bottle per day. For everyone. The Committee's orders. And it's just fair, too.
6192355000959497 I'm not sure. This water is indeed strange. It has this odor… but that doesn't mean anything. Let me think.
6192355000959493 How would I know if it's dangerous? I guess it would be smart to take a sample to 丹考夫斯基. He's the microscope man.
6192355000959496 You know what? Take this barrel to the outskirts, to 拉薇尔's house. I'll examine it there.
6192355000959492 You've gone all pale, doctor… Is everything okay? Is the water fine in this barrel?
6192355001169725 You know what? Take this barrel to the outskirts, to 拉薇尔's house. I'll examine it there.
6192355001653001 Calm down, will you? If I decide there is reason to worry, I'll hurry to 丹考夫斯基 with a sample of water instead of chatting with you.
6192355001169727 不。 I'm still thinking. It takes time. Not that you would know.
6192355001169724 So? Did you think it over? Any orders?
